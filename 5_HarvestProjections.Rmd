# Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the final base model, 
with the forecasted calculations of the OFL and ACL presented in Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection}. For 2019 and 2020, mortality estimates were provided by the Groundfish Management Team based on recent trends in catch. For 2021 and beyond, estimated total mortality is assumed equal to the ACL in each year.

The decision table including alternative catch streams for the alternative states of nature is presented in Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1_text}.
