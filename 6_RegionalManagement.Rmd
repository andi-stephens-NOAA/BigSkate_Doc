# Regional Management Considerations

Big Skate is not managed to regional specifications. There is also little evidence that regional management is needed for this stock. The population status is relatively healthy and changes in relative abundance as estimated in the index standardization process appear to be correlated along the coast suggesting either that the stock is responding to similar drivers throughout the area or that movement mitigates any local impacts.
