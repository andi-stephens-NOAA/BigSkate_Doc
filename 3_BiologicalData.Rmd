### Biological Parameters and Data

**Measurement Details and Conversion Factors**

Disc width to total length (estimated by Ian on Apr 15, similar to Ebert 2008 estimates for Alaska)
L = 1.3399 * W estimated from 95 samples from WCGBTS where both measurements collected (R-squared = 0.9983). Little sex difference observed, so using single relationship for both sexes.
Inter-spiracle width to total length from Downs & Cheng (2013): 
L = 12.111 + 9.761*ISW (females)
L = 3.824 + 10.927*ISW (males)

**Length and Age Compositions**

Length comps (some based on widths)

WCGBTS
Lengths from all years except 2006 and 2007
Widths in 2006 and 2007

Triennial Survey
Sample sizes: 3 in 1998 (all widths), 84 in 2001 (3 widths, 81 lengths), 100 in 2004 (all lengths)
Triennial survey
About 90+ samples in each of 2001 and 2004 
Only 3 unsexed fish from 1998

Commercial fisheries
In process
Discard comps from 2010-2015


Length compositions were provided from the following sources:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item Source 1 (\emph{type, e.g., commercial dead fish, research, recreational}, yyyy-yyyy)    
  \item Source 2 (\emph{type}, yyyy-yyyy)    
  \item Source 3 (\emph{research}, yyyy, yyyy, yyyy, yyyy) 
\end{itemize}


The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet is in Figure
\ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time}.  Descriptions and details of the length
composition data are in the above section for each fleet or survey.

**Age Structures**


von Bertalanffy growth curve [@vonBertalanffy1938], $L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, 
where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in years, $k$ is rate of 
increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ is the asymptotic length.

Ages
WCGBTS
Currently only 333 ages from 2010 present in data warehouse as of Apr 15
Patrick submitting an 300 additional ages from 2016 and 2017 to Beth on Apr 2 and promised further additions during the week of Apr 15.

Triennial Survey 
No ages

Commercial fisheries
2009 samples from WA were stratified by length, so should be treated as conditionals

**Aging Precision and Bias**

**Weight-Length**

Estimated by Ian based on WCGBT samples (n = 1159)
$Weight = 0.0000074924  * Length ^ 2.9925$ (Figure \ref{fig:weight-length}).

**Sex Ratio, Maturity, and Fecundity**

The female maturity relationship was based on visual maturity estimates from port samplers (n = 278, of which 241 were from Oregon and 37 from Washington, with 24 mature specimens) as well as 55 samples from the WCGBTS (of which 4 were mature). The resulting relationship was $L_{50\%} = 148.2453$ with a slope parameter of $Beta = -0.13155$ in the relationship $M = (1 + Beta(L - L_{50\%}))^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).

**Natural Mortality**

The Hamel prior for M is lognormal(ln(5.4/max age),.438), which based on 1 age-15 fish out of 1034 observed in the WCGBTS results in lognormal( -1.021651, 0.438)

If it needs to be fixed, it should be set to M = 5.4/max age = 5.4/15 = 0.36

### Environmental or Ecosystem Data Included in the Assessment
In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations were explicitly included in the analysis.  This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.
