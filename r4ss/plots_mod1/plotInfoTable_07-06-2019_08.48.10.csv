"data_plot2.png","Data presence by year for each fleet, where circle area is <br>  relative within a data type. Circles are proportional to <br>  total catch for catches; to precision for indices, discards, and <br>  mean body weight observations; and to total sample size for <br> compositions and mean weight- or length-at-age observations. <br> 'Ghost' observations (not included in the likelihood) have <br> equal size for all years. <br> Note that since the circles are are scaled relative <br>  to maximum within each type, the scaling within separate plots <br>  should not be compared.","Data",2019-06-07 08:48:10,"StartTime: Thu Jun 6 09:43:03 2019"
