### History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock

No previous stock assessment has been conducted for Big Skate. The current management is based on an OFL estimate calculated from a proxy for $F_{MSY}$ and average survey biomass from the WCGBT Survey during the years 2010--2012 [@Taylor2013]. The $F_{MSY}$ estimate was based on the product of an assumed $F_{MSY}/M$ ratio and an $M$ estimate of 0.162 based on the maximum age of 26 reported by McFarlane and King [@McFarlane2006]. Values were sampled from an assumed distribution around all these quantities to develop a measure of uncertainty around the OFL estimate.

<!-- ************************MODEL DESCRIPTION***************************** -->
## Model Description

### Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.13 (@Methot2013, @Methot2019).
The r4ss package version 1.35.1 [@Taylor2019] was used to post-process the output data from Stock Synthesis.

### Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas
Catch is divided among 4 fleets in the base model:
*Fishery (current)* combines all non-tribal sources of catch for the years 1995 onward,
*Discard (historical)* includes the estimated discard amount calculated from the estimated Longnose Skate discard rate as described above. The input catch for this fleet was 50% of the total estimate to account for the assumed 50% discard mortality rate. This data covers the period 1916--1994.
*Fishery (historical)* includes the reconstructed landings estimates from each of the three states for 1916--1994.
*Tribal* includes the estimates of catch of Big Skate by treaty tribes.


### Other Specifications

This assessment covers the U.S. West Coast stock of Big Skate in off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, the area bounded by the U.S.-Canada border to the north, and the U.S.-Mexico border to the south. The population is treated as a single coastwide stock with no net movement in or out of the area. Females and males are modeled separately as there is evidence for differences in growth based on both the age and length data, as well as patterns in the sex ratios associated with the length composition data. Natural Mortality is estimated within the model using natural mortality prior developed by Hamel (2015). A Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function is assumed with no deviations from the spawner-recruit curve estimated. 

The length composition data are stratified into 37 5-cm bins, ranging between 20 and 200 cm and the age data are stratified into ages 0--15+, conditioned on the same length bin structure. The population dynamics are computed over a larger range of lengths age ages, with the 5-cm length bins extending up to 250 cm and the numbers-at-age computed up to age 20.

### Data Weighting
The Francis [-@Francis2011] data weighting method "TA1.8" as implemented in the r4ss package was used for all length and age composition data.

### Priors
*Natural mortality*

A log-normal prior for natural mortality was based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015]. The Hamel prior for M is lognormal(ln(5.4/max age), .438), which based on the single 15-year-old fish observed out of 1034 ages from the WCGBT Survey. This results in lognormal(log(0.36)=-1.021651, 0.438) prior.

<!--If it needs to be fixed, it should be set to M = 5.4/max age = 5.4/15 = 0.36 -->

*Survey catchability*

The lack of contrast in the data resulted in unstable model results under a variety of configurations. To keep biomass estimates within a plausibel range, a prior was applied to the catchability parameter ($q$) for the WCGBT Survey. This same prior was developed for the 2007 Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2007] and is being used for the current Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2019]. The prior for the WCGBT Survey was derived as follows.

The WCGBT Survey covers the full latitudinal range of longnose skate modeled in the assessment, and thus, the latitudinal availability factor was assumed to be one (complete latitudinal coverage).  The survey coverage exceeds the maximum depth distribution of longnose skate but may not fully cover the shallow end of the skate distribution.  A range of 95 to 100 percent was assumed for the depth availability.  A range of 75 to 95 percent was assumed for vertical availability on the basis that longnose skate are known to bury in the mud and therefore some may be unavailable to the bottom trawl gear.  The largest bounds were placed on the probability of capture, given a fish is in the net path.  It is known that flatfish can be herded by trawl gear, and it is possible that this could also occur for skates.  However, it is also possible that skate could avoid the trawl nets.  For capture probability, a range of 75 to 150 percent was assumed.  Best estimates for each factors were set at the midpoint of the range for individual factors, except for the probability of capture, which was given a value of one. The overall estimate for the survey catchability was thus estimated to be 0.83 and the consequent bounds on catch, and the best assumption are: (0.53, 1.43) and 0.83 respectively. The best estimate was equated to the median of a lognormal distribution and the bounds to 99 percent of that distribution. This resulted in a normal prior on $log(q)$, with a mean of  -0.188, and standard deviation of 0.187.


### Estimated and Fixed Parameters

A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables 
\ref{tab:model_params}. 

The base model has a total of 44 estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 natural mortality parameter,
  \item 6 parameters related to female growth and the variability in length age age,
  \item 2 parameters related to male growth relative to female growth,
  \item 1 stock-recruit parameter ($log(R_0)$ controlling equilibrium recruitment)
  \item 3 catchability parameters (1 for the WCGBT Survey and 1 each for the early and late periods of the Triennial Survey)
  \item 2 extra standard deviation parameters (1 for each survey), and
  \item 29 selectivity parameters, including 16 related to time-varying retention rate
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and parameters is provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.

_Growth._ 

Examination of patterns of age-at-length and length-at-age indicated unusual patterns of growth for Big Skate, including almost linear growth for the early years during which both sexes appeared to have similar average size, followed by strong differences in size at older ages. This led to the choice to model growth using the "growth cessation model" recently developed by Maunder et al. [-@maunder2018growth]. This model provided two key advantages over the more common von Bertalanffy growth model in the case of Big Skate: it allowed essentially linear growth for the early years and it allowed growth for the earlier ages to be similar between females and males while diverging at older ages. The growth cessation model also improve the negative log likelihood by 45 units relative to the von Bertalanffy growth model.

_Natural Mortality._

Male natural mortality was assumed equal to the value estimated for females. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the impact of both the the prior on natural mortality and the assumption of equal natural mortality for both sexes.

_Selectivity._  

A double-normal selectivity function was used for all fleets to allow consideration of both asymptotic and dome-shaped patterns. For the fishery and the Triennial survey, the difference in likelihood between dome-shaped and asymptotic patterns was very small and in the case of the Triennial survey, the dome-shape occurred at a length beyond almost all observations, indicating that this shape was likely driven by fit to other data sources, such as the index, rather than the length composition data. The WCGBT Survey was allowed to remain dome-shaped as this survey had the selectivity peak at a smaller length than the other fleets and the likelihood was improved by the dome-shape. The WCGBT Survey also has the shortest hauls, with 15 minutes or less of bottom contact, so larger skates may be better able to escape the net.

In order to fit a strong skew in the sex ratios toward males for the length bins in which the majority of the samples were found, it was necessary to estimate a sex-specific offset of selectivity. Two offset parameters were estimated for all fleets, one for the difference in length at peak selectivity and another for the maximum selectivity. The ascending slope was assumed equal in all cases, as was the descending slope for the WCGBT Survey.

_Other Estimated Parameters._ 

_Other Fixed Parameters._ 

Steepness was fixed at 0.4.

<!-- *********************MODEL 1 RESULTS********************************** -->
## Base Case Model Results 
The following description of the model results reflects a base model that 
incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel (see previous section). 
The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic standard errors 
are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are in 
Table \ref{tab:like_components}.  Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.



### Parameter Estimates

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys was estimated within the model.  



(Figure \ref{fig:ts11_Age-0_recruits_(1000s)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals} ). 

The stock-recruit curve ... Figure \ref{fig:SR_curve2} with estimated recruitments also 
shown. 

### Fits to the Data
Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length 
composition, discard rates, mean body weight, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below.  

The observed indices show much more variability than the model expectation, with the fit to the WCGBT Survey essentially a flat line (Figure \ref{fig:index2_cpuefit_WCGBTS}) and the fit to the Triennial Survey only showing a noticeable change over time due to the separate catchability parameter estimated for the early and late periods (Figure \ref{fig:index2_cpuefit_Triennial}).

The fits to the length data are much better thanks to the combination of the growth cessation model and the sex-specific offsets to selectivity (Figures \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_aggregated_across_time}--\ref{fig:comp_lenfit__multi-fleet_comparison}).

The conditional age-at-length data is likewise fit reasonably well, with some patterns in residuals showing variability among years, but no clear pattern that is consistent across years (Figures \ref{fig:age_fit_fishery} and \ref{fig:age_fit_WCGBTS}).

Sex ratio data is not included in the likelihood as such, but a part of the length composition likelihood in which the proportions of females and males are included in a single vector comapred to the model expectations in the multinomial likelihood. The patterns in sex ratio by length bin show fewer females than males for the middle range of sizes (70--120 cm), with a shift to almost 100% females for the largest size bins (over 130 cm). The use of sex-specific growth curves was adequate to fit the ratios for the largest bins, but ratio skews toward males at lengths where the mean ages are similar for females and males. The fit to this part of the sex ratio pattern required an offset is selectivity.


### Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Setting all selectivity curves to be asymptotic
  
  \item Setting all selectivity curves to be dome-shaped

  \item Removing the sex-specific offset on the selectivity curves
  
  \item Removing the prior on catchability for the WCGBT Survey
  
  \item Estimating a single catchability for all years in the Triennial Survey
  
  \item Estimating separate natural mortality parameters for males and females
  
  \item Removing the prior on natural mortality
  
  \item Using the von Bertalanffy growth model

  \item Using the Richards growth model

  \item Tuning the sample sizes using the McAllister-Ianelli method
  
  \item Estimating historic discards based on 3yr average of discard rates and landings
  
  \item Changeing discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.4
  
  \item Changeing discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.6
  
\end{enumerate}

Results of these sensitivities are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} to \ref{fig:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}, and Tables \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} to \ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}.

### Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished 
level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt. 


(Figure \ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}

The `r LastYR` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass 
is above/below the target of 40% of unfished 
levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, has been xxx the management target 
for the entire time series of the model. 

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base 
model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value xxx.
