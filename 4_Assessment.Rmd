<!-- ### History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock -->

No previous stock assessment has been conducted for Big Skate. The current management is based on an OFL estimate calculated from a proxy for $F_{MSY}$ and average survey biomass from the WCGBT Survey during the years 2010--2012 [@Taylor2013]. The $F_{MSY}$ estimate was based on the product of an assumed $F_{MSY}/M$ ratio and an $M$ estimate of 0.162 based on the maximum age of 26 reported by McFarlane and King [@McFandKing2006]. Values were sampled from an assumed distribution around all these quantities to develop a measure of uncertainty around the OFL estimate.

<!-- ************************MODEL DESCRIPTION***************************** -->
## Model Description

### Modeling Software

The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.13 (@Methot2013, @Methot2019).
The r4ss package version 1.35.1 [@Taylor2019] was used to post-process the output data from Stock Synthesis.

### Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas

Catch is divided among 4 fleets in the base model:

\begin{itemize}
\item *Fishery (current)* combines all non-tribal sources of catch for the years 1995 onward,
\item *Discard (historical)* includes the estimated discard amount calculated from the estimated Longnose Skate discard rate as described above. The input catch for this fleet was 50% of the total estimate to account for the assumed 50% discard mortality rate. This data covers the period 1916--1994.
\item *Fishery (historical)* includes the reconstructed landings estimates from each of the three states for 1916--1994.
\item*Tribal* includes the estimates of catch of Big Skate by treaty tribes.
\end{itemize}

### Other Specifications

This assessment covers the U.S. West Coast stock of Big Skate in off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, the area bounded by the U.S.-Canada border to the north, and the U.S.-Mexico border to the south. The population is treated as a single coastwide stock with no net movement in or out of the area. Females and males are modeled separately as there is evidence for differences in growth based on both the age and length data, as well as patterns in the sex ratios associated with the length composition data. Natural Mortality is estimated within the model using natural mortality prior developed by Hamel (2015). A Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function is assumed with no deviations from the spawner-recruit curve estimated. 

The length composition data are stratified into 37 5-cm bins, ranging between 20 and 200 cm and the age data are stratified into ages 0--15+, conditioned on the same length bin structure. The population dynamics are computed over a larger range of lengths age ages, with the 5-cm length bins extending up to 250 cm and the numbers-at-age computed up to age 20.

### Data Weighting

The Francis [-@Francis2011] data weighting method "TA1.8" as implemented in the r4ss package was used for all length and age composition data.

### Priors

*Natural Mortality*
A log-normal prior for natural mortality was based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015]. The Hamel prior for M is lognormal(ln(5.4/max age), .438), which based on the single 15-year-old fish observed out of 1034 ages from the WCGBT Survey. This results in lognormal(log(0.36) = --1.021651, 0.438) prior.

<!--If it needs to be fixed, it should be set to M = 5.4/max age = 5.4/15 = 0.36 -->

\vspace{.5cm}

*Survey Catchability*
The lack of contrast in the data resulted in unstable model results under a variety of configurations. To keep biomass estimates within a plausable range, the assessment uses a prior on the WCGBTS survey catchability parameter ($q$) that was originally developed for the 2007 Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2007], and is being used for the concurrent Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2019]. The prior for the WCGBT Survey was derived as follows.

The prior is based on consideration of the availability of longnose skate to the survey gear and the probability that a skate in the path of the gear would be caught and retained by the gear. The methodology for developing the prior involves specifying the potential range in the proportion of fish that are available to the gear and the potential range in the vulnerability to the gear, and “best guesses” for the individual probabilities.  These values are translated into a lognormal prior where the median of the lognormal is the “best guess” and the range of plausible values covers 99% of the lognormal
distribution.

Several factors inform catchability in the survey.  The WCGBT Survey covers the full latitudinal range of Longnose Skate modeled in the assessment, and thus, the latitudinal availability factor was assumed to be one (complete latitudinal coverage).  The survey coverage exceeds the maximum depth distribution of Longnose Skates but doesn't fully cover the shallow end of the skate distribution.  A range of 95 to 100 percent was assumed for the depth availability.  A range of 75 to 95 percent was assumed for vertical availability on the basis that skates are known to bury in the mud, and therefore some may be unavailable to the bottom trawl gear.  

The largest bounds were placed on the probability of capture, given that a fish is in the net path.  It is known that flatfish can be herded by trawl gear, and it is possible that this could also occur for skates.  However, it is also possible that skate could avoid the trawl nets.  For capture probability, a range of 75 to 150 percent was assumed.  The best estimates for each of these factors were set at the midpoint of the range for individual factors, except for the probability of capture, which was given a value of one. The overall estimate for the survey catchability was the product of the best estimates, 0.83.  The bounds on catchability are the products of the low and high values for factor ranges, respecively, which are 0.53 and 1.43. The best guess was equated to the median of a lognormal distribution and the bounds to 99% of that distribution. This gave a normal prior on $log(q)$, with mean  --0.188 and standard deviation 0.187.

### Estimated Parameters

A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables 
\ref{tab:model_params}. 

The base model has a total of 44 estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 natural mortality parameter applied to both sexes,
  \item 6 parameters related to female growth and the variability in length at age
  \item 2 parameters relating male growth to female growth,
  \item 1 stock-recruit parameter ($log(R_0)$ controlling equilibrium recruitment)
  \item 3 catchability parameters (1 for the WCGBT Survey and 1 each for the early and late periods of the Triennial Survey)
  \item 2 extra standard deviation parameters (1 for each survey)
  \item 29 selectivity parameters, including 16 related to time-varying retention rate
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and parameters is provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.

_Growth._ 
Examination of patterns of age-at-length and length-at-age indicated unusual patterns of growth for Big Skate.  The youngest fish show near-linear growth, and average size for both sexes is similar.  However, older fish show considerable sex-based differences in size. This led to the choice to model growth using the "growth cessation model" recently developed by Maunder et al. [-@maunder2018growth]. The estimated growth curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:growth}. The growth cessation model provided two key advantages over the more common von Bertalanffy growth model in the case of Big Skate: it allowed essentially linear growth for the early years and it allowed growth for the earlier ages to be similar between females and males while diverging at older ages. The growth cessation model also improve the negative log likelihood by 45 units relative to the von Bertalanffy growth model.

_Natural Mortality._
Male natural mortality was assumed equal to the value estimated for females. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the impact of both the the prior on natural mortality and the assumption of equal natural mortality for both sexes.

_Selectivity._  
A double-normal selectivity function was used for all fleets to allow consideration of both asymptotic and dome-shaped patterns. For the fishery and the Triennial survey, the difference in likelihood between dome-shaped and asymptotic patterns was very small and in the case of the Triennial survey, the dome-shape occurred at a length beyond almost all observations, indicating that this shape was likely driven by fit to other data sources, such as the index, rather than the length composition data. The WCGBT Survey was allowed to remain dome-shaped as this survey had the selectivity peak at a smaller length than the other fleets and the likelihood was improved by the dome-shape. The WCGBT Survey also has the shortest hauls, with 15 minutes or less of bottom contact, so larger skates may be better able to escape the net.

In order to fit a strong skew in the sex ratios toward males for the length bins in which the majority of the samples were found, it was necessary to estimate a sex-specific offset of selectivity. Two offset parameters were estimated for all fleets, one for the difference in length at peak selectivity and another for the maximum selectivity. The ascending slope was assumed equal in all cases, as was the descending slope for the WCGBT Survey.

### Fixed Parameters

The steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curve was fixed at 0.4. The same value was used in the 2007 Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2007] ans is being considered for the ongoing 2019 Longnose Skate assessment.  This value reflects a K-type reproductive strategy associated with elasmobranchs in general. The influence of the assumption of $h=0.4$ on model output was explored via a likelihood profile analysis.

## Base Case Model Results 

The following description of the model results reflects a base model that 
incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel (see previous section). 
The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic standard errors 
are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are in 
Table \ref{tab:like_components}.  Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.


### Parameter Estimates

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys was estimated within the model.  

(Figure \ref{fig:ts11_Age-0_recruits_(1000s)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals} ).

### Fits to the Data

<!-- Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length  -->
<!-- composition, discard rates, mean body weight, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below.   -->

_Indices._
The observed indices show much more variability than the model expectation, with the fit to the WCGBT Survey essentially a flat line (Figure \ref{fig:index2_cpuefit_WCGBTS}) and the fit to the Triennial Survey only showing a noticeable change over time due to the separate catchability parameter estimated for the early and late periods (Figure \ref{fig:index2_cpuefit_Triennial}).

_Length Data._
The fits to the length data were reasonably good (Figures \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_aggregated_across_time}--\ref{fig:comp_lenfit__multi-fleet_comparison} and \ref{fig:mod1_1_comp_lenfit_flt1mkt2}--\ref{fig:mod1_4_comp_lenfit_flt6mkt0}). The observed length compositions for males in both the fishery and the WCGBT Survey is bimodal, with modes in the 80 cm and 115 cm length bins for the fishery, and in the 60 cm and 115 cm bins for the survey. The model expectation has modes in similar locations in both cases, where the first mode is close to the estimated peak selectivity value and the second is close to the estimated male L-infinity parameter. However, the second mode in the model expectation is less pronounced than in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_aggregated_across_time}). The residual patterns in the fit to the length compositions don't show strong patterns, with the WCGBT Survey data especially well fit. The residuals in the fit to the fishery length compositions show a few large residuals in the early years as a few years where there were observations of small (under 50 cm) fish in the retained fishery catch which the model expected would have been discarded (Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit__multi-fleet_comparison}). The fit to the length data in alternative models that lacked either the growth cessation model or the sex-specific offsets to selectivity were less good.

_Conditional Age-at-Length._
The conditional age-at-length data is likewise fit reasonably well, with some patterns in residuals showing variability among years, but no clear pattern that is consistent across years (Figures \ref{fig:age_fit_fishery} and \ref{fig:age_fit_WCGBTS}).

_Sex Ratios._
Sex ratio data is not included in the likelihood as such, but as a part of the length composition likelihood. The proportions of females and males are compiled into a single vector that is  compared to the model expectations in the multinomial likelihood. The patterns in sex ratio by length bin show fewer females than males for the middle range of sizes (70--120 cm), with a shift to almost 100% females for the largest size bins (over 130 cm). The use of sex-specific growth curves was adequate to fit the ratios for the largest bins, but ratio skews toward males at lengths where the mean ages are similar for females and males. The fit to this part of the sex ratio pattern required an offset in selectivity.

### Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Allowing all selectivity curves to be dome-shaped

  \item Removing the sex-specific offset on the selectivity curves
  
  \item Removing the prior on catchability for the WCGBT Survey
  
  \item Estimating a single catchability for all years in the Triennial Survey
  
  \item Estimating separate natural mortality parameters for males and females
  
  \item Removing the prior on natural mortality
  
  \item Using the von Bertalanffy growth model

  \item Using the Richards growth model

  \item Tuning the sample sizes using the McAllister-Ianelli method
  
  \item Estimating historic discards based on 3yr average of discard rates and landings
  
  \item Changing discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.4
  
  \item Changing discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.6

  \item Estimating multipliers on historical discards over blocks of time
  
\end{enumerate}

Results of these sensitivities are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} to \ref{fig:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}, and Tables \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} to \ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}.

Allowing the selectivity for all fleets to be dome-shaped resulted in domed selectivity for all fleets, but only improved the total likelihood by 0.9 units, mostly through a slightly improved fit to the length compositions, although the fit to the surveys was slightly worse (Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}). Removing the offset between female and male selectivity caused the likelihood to be worse by 18.1 units, mostly through a worse fit to the length comps but also a worse fit to the conditional age-at-length compositions. The conditional age data was represented indepdently for each sex, so no sex-ratio information was present in the data, but the growth curves were changed slightly to compensate for the change in fit to the length data, resulting in a less good fit to the age data as well. The scale of the population remained somewhat similar to the base model under both of these sensitivities (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}).

Removing the prior on catchability for the WCGBT Survey had a large change in the estimated scale of the population, with the unfished equilibrium biomass increasing from the 2,224 mt estimated in the base model to 9,932 mt ("Q no prior on WCGBTS" in Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} and Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}). However, the change in likelihood was relatively small, with the total improving by 0.4 units, of which 0.04 was associated with the prior itself.

The sensitivity analyses related to discard mortality resulted in little change in the scale of the population for any scenario (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_catch} and Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_catch}). Increasing or descring the discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.4 or 0.6 had the least impact, while the two alternative time series of discards caused the population to fall to a lower level around 1990 and increase faster in the recent period. The discards based on 3-yr average analysis simply used the alternative time series of historical discards described above and shown in Figure \ref{fig:discard_calculations}.

The sensitivity analysis in which multipliers on historical discards were estimated made use of the relatively new "catch multiplier" option in Stock Synthesis. Multiplier parameters controling the ratio of the discards removed from the model relative to the input values were estimated for blocks of time covering the periods 1916--1949, 1950--1959, 1960--1969, 1970--1979, 1980--1989, and 1990--1994. These multiplier parameters were bounded to keep the input catch relative to the estimated total within the range 0.5--1.5 and a weak Beta prior distribution spawning this range was applied to the parameters to keep them from hitting the bounds and cause them to remain at 1.0 in the absence of information in the data.

The resulting pattern of historical discards shows a steadily increasing catch, with higher catch relative to the input values in all the blocks up to a peak in the 1980s, followed by an estimated decrease in the estimated catch for the 1990-1994 period (Figures \ref{fig:catch_multiplier_total_catch} and \ref{fig:catch_multiplier_catch_comparison}). These changes provide a greater contrast in the catch history, causing the estimated time series of spawning biomass to fall to a lower level and then increase faster from the 1990s onward, thus fitting the WCGBT Survey slightly better (Figures \ref{fig:Sensitivity_catch} and {fig:Sensitivity_catch2}). However, the improvement in likelihood for the survey was only 0.3 units (Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_catch}).

**$\color{red}{\text{Add text about biology and assorted sensitivities}}$**

### Retrospective Analysis

Retrospective analyses, in which the final 5 years of data are successively removed from the model, showed relatively little change in the scale of the estimated population, but the uncertainty about the population size increased (Figure \ref{fig:retro}). The WCGBT Survey observations were underfit for the final 5 years, so removing these points, combined with a prior on catchability lowers the status of the stock, led to a slightly reduced estimated spawning biomass.

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted over $log(R_0)$, stock-recruit steepness ($h$) and natural mortality ($M$).

Results of these profiles are shown in Figures \ref{fig:profile_logR0} to \ref{fig:profile_M_compare1_spawnbio}.

**$\color{red}{\text{Additional text to be added}}$**


### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished 
level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt. 


(Figure \ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}

The `r LastYR` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass 
is above/below the target of 40% of unfished 
levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, has been xxx the management target 
for the entire time series of the model. 

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base 
model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value xxx.
