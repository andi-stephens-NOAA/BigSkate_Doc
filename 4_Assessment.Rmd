## Previous Assessments

<!-- ### History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock -->

No previous stock assessment has been conducted for Big Skate. The current management is based on an OFL estimate calculated from a proxy for $F_{MSY}$ and average survey biomass from the WCGBT Survey during the years 2010--2012 [@Taylor2013]. The $F_{MSY}$ estimate was based on the product of an assumed $F_{MSY}/M$ ratio and an $M$ estimate of 0.162 based on the maximum age of 26 reported by McFarlane and King [@McFandKing2006]. Values were sampled from an assumed distribution around all these quantities to develop a measure of uncertainty around the OFL estimate.

<!-- ************************MODEL DESCRIPTION***************************** -->
## Model Description

### Modeling Software

The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.13 (@Methot2013, @Methot2019).
The r4ss package version 1.35.1 [@Taylor2019] was used to post-process the output data from Stock Synthesis.

### Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas

Catch is divided among 4 fleets in the base model:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fishery (current) combines all non-tribal sources of catch for the years 1995 onward,
\item Discard (historical) includes the estimated discard amount calculated from the estimated Longnose Skate discard rate as described above. The input catch for this fleet was 50% of the total estimate to account for the assumed 50% discard mortality rate. This data covers the period 1916--1994.
\item Fishery (historical) includes the reconstructed landings estimates from each of the three states for 1916--1994.
\item Tribal includes the estimates of catch of Big Skate by treaty tribes.
\end{itemize}

### Other Specifications

This assessment covers the U.S. West Coast stock of Big Skate in off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, the area bounded by the U.S.-Canada border to the north, and the U.S.-Mexico border to the south. The population is treated as a single coastwide stock with no net movement in or out of the area. Females and males are modeled separately as there is evidence for differences in growth based on both the age and length data, as well as patterns in the sex ratios associated with the length composition data. Natural Mortality is estimated within the model using a natural mortality prior developed by Hamel (2015). A Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function is assumed with no deviations from the spawner-recruit curve estimated. 

The length composition data are stratified into 37 5-cm bins, ranging between 20 and 200 cm and the age data are stratified into ages 0--15+, conditioned on the same length bin structure. The population dynamics are computed over a larger range of lengths-at-age, with the 5-cm length bins extending up to 250 cm and the numbers-at-age computed up to age 20.

### Data Weighting

The Francis [-@Francis2011] data weighting method "TA1.8" as implemented in the r4ss package was used for all length and age composition data.

### Priors

*Natural Mortality*
A log-normal prior for natural mortality was based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015]. The Hamel prior for M is lognormal(ln(5.4/max age), .438), which based on the single 15-year-old fish observed out of 1034 ages from the WCGBT Survey. This results in lognormal(log(0.36) = --1.021651, 0.438) prior.

<!--If it needs to be fixed, it should be set to M = 5.4/max age = 5.4/15 = 0.36 -->

\vspace{.5cm}

*Survey Catchability*
The lack of contrast in the data resulted in unstable model results under a variety of configurations. To keep biomass estimates within a plausible range, the assessment uses a prior on the WCGBTS survey catchability parameter ($q$) that was originally developed for the 2007 Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2007, @Dorn2007], and is being used for the concurrent Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2019]. The prior for the WCGBT Survey was derived as follows.

The prior is based on consideration of the availability of longnose skate to the survey gear and the probability that a skate in the path of the gear would be caught and retained by the gear. The methodology for developing the prior involves specifying the potential range in the proportion of fish that are available to the gear and the potential range in the vulnerability to the gear, and “best guesses” for the individual probabilities.  These values are translated into a lognormal prior where the median of the lognormal is the “best guess” and the range of plausible values covers 99% of the lognormal
distribution.

Several factors inform catchability in the survey.  The WCGBT Survey covers the full latitudinal range of Longnose Skate modeled in the assessment, and thus, the latitudinal availability factor was assumed to be one (complete latitudinal coverage).  The survey coverage exceeds the maximum depth distribution of Longnose Skates but doesn't fully cover the shallow end of the skate distribution.  A range of 95 to 100 percent was assumed for the depth availability.  A range of 75 to 95 percent was assumed for vertical availability on the basis that skates are known to bury in the mud, and therefore some may be unavailable to the bottom trawl gear.  

The largest bounds were placed on the probability of capture, given that a fish is in the net path.  It is known that flatfish can be herded by trawl gear, and it is possible that this could also occur for skates.  However, it is also possible that skate could avoid the trawl nets.  For capture probability, a range of 75 to 150 percent was assumed.  The best estimates for each of these factors were set at the midpoint of the range for individual factors, except for the probability of capture, which was given a value of one. The overall estimate for the survey catchability was the product of the best estimates, 0.83.  The bounds on catchability are the products of the low and high values for factor ranges, respectively, which are 0.53 and 1.43. The best guess was equated to the median of a lognormal distribution and the bounds to 99% of that distribution. This gave a normal prior on $log(q)$, with mean  --0.188 and standard deviation 0.187.

### Estimated Parameters

A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables 
\ref{tab:model_params}. 

The base model has a total of 44 estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 natural mortality parameter applied to both sexes,
  \item 6 parameters related to female growth and the variability in length at age
  \item 2 parameters relating male growth to female growth,
  \item 1 stock-recruit parameter ($log(R_0)$ controlling equilibrium recruitment)
  \item 3 catchability parameters (1 for the WCGBT Survey and 1 each for the early and late periods of the Triennial Survey)
  \item 2 extra standard deviation parameters (1 for each survey)
  \item 29 selectivity parameters, including 16 related to time-varying retention rate
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and parameters is provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.

_Growth._ 
Examination of patterns of age-at-length and length-at-age indicated unusual patterns of growth for Big Skate.  The youngest fish show near-linear growth, and average size for both sexes is similar.  However, older fish show considerable sex-based differences in size. This led to the choice to model growth using the "growth cessation model" recently developed by Maunder et al. [-@maunder2018growth]. The estimated growth curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:growth}. The growth cessation model provided two key advantages over the more common von Bertalanffy growth model in the case of Big Skate: it allowed essentially linear growth for the early years and it allowed growth for the earlier ages to be similar between females and males while diverging at older ages. The growth cessation model also improve the negative log-likelihood by 45 units relative to the von Bertalanffy growth model.

_Natural Mortality._
Male natural mortality was assumed equal to the value estimated for females. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the impact of both the prior on natural mortality and the assumption of equal natural mortality for both sexes.

_Selectivity._  
A double-normal selectivity function was used for all fleets to allow consideration of both asymptotic and dome-shaped patterns. No length compositions data was available for the historical fishery, the historical discards, or the tribal fisheyr, so selectivity was assumed equal for all fisheries in all time periods, and will be referenced simply as "the fishery" in many areas below. For the fishery and the Triennial survey, the difference in likelihood between dome-shaped and asymptotic patterns was very small and in the case of the Triennial survey, the dome-shape occurred at a length beyond almost all observations, indicating that this shape was likely driven by fit to other data sources, such as the index, rather than the length composition data. The WCGBT Survey was allowed to remain dome-shaped as this survey had the selectivity peak at a smaller length than the other fleets and the likelihood was improved by the dome-shape. The WCGBT Survey also has the shortest hauls, with 15 minutes or less of bottom contact, so larger skates may be better able to escape the net.

In order to fit a strong skew in the sex ratios toward males for the length bins in which the majority of the samples were found, it was necessary to estimate a sex-specific offset of selectivity. Two offset parameters were estimated for all fleets, one for the difference in length at peak selectivity and another for the maximum selectivity at that peak (allowing one sex to have a maximum of 1.0 at the peak and the other to have a maximum less than 1.0). The ascending slope was assumed equal in all cases, as was the descending slope for the WCGBT Survey.

Fishery retention was estimated as a logistic function applied to the selected catch from 1995 onward to estimate discards within the model. Discards prior to 1995 were estimated outside the model and input as the historical discard fleet as discussed above. Three retention parameters were estimated, the length at 50% retention, a slope parameter, and the asymptotic retention rate. The asymptotic retention rate was estimated as time-varying with separate parameters covering 1995--2004, individual years from 2005 to 2016, and 2017--onward. The choice of these time blocks was made to allow the model to fit well the discard rates during the 2005--2016 period with the most information about discard rates, while using the first three years with data on discard rates and mean body weight of the discarded fish (2002--2004) as the basis for the estimate applied to the earlier years without discard data.

### Fixed Parameters

The steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curve was fixed at 0.4. The same value was used in the 2007 Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2007] and is being considered for the ongoing 2019 Longnose Skate assessment.  This value reflects a K-type reproductive strategy associated with elasmobranchs in general. The influence of the assumption of $h=0.4$ on model output was explored via a likelihood profile analysis.

<!-- *********************MODEL 1 RESULTS********************************** -->

## Base Case Model Results 

The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic standard errors 
are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.  Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

### Parameter Estimates

Values of all estimated parameters are provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}. A few key parameters of note include natural mortality estimated at 0.445, slightly above the 0.36 median of the prior and with much narrower uncertainty than the prior (Figure \ref{fig:fit_to_priors}), L-infinity at 175.67 for females and 120.97 for males (based on an exponential offset of -0.373). The $log(R_0)$ parameter was estimated at 8.728, corresponding to an unfished equilibrium recruitment of 6.18 million.

Catchability from the WCGBT Survey was estimated at 0.81, close the median of the prior applied to this parameter, with uncertainty estimated as very similar to the uncertainty in the prior (Figure \ref{fig:fit_to_priors}).

Selectivity was estimated to be asymptotic for the WCGBT Survey (the only fleet for which it was allowed to be dome-shaped), with the peak selectivity occurring at 76 cm, below the peak of the fishery selectivity at 94 cm (Figure \ref{fig:sel01_multiple_fleets_length1}). These two fleets had a similar estimate for the lower maximum selectivity for females than males, at 0.696 for the survey and 0.744 for the fishery. Selectivity for the Triennial survey was substantially different from the other two, with an additional parameter estimated for the initial selectivity of the smallest sizes necessary to fit the very flat length compositions from the two years of data available, and a peak occurring at 188 cm, far higher than the other two curves. When converted to age, the selectivity peaked at about age-4 for the WCGBT Survey, age-5 for the fishery, and age 7 and 12 for males and females in the Triennial Survey, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:sel02_multiple_fleets_age2}).


### Fits to the Data

<!-- Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length  -->
<!-- composition, discard rates, mean body weight, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below.   -->

_Indices._
The observed indices show much more variability than the model expectation, with the fit to the WCGBT Survey essentially a flat line (Figure \ref{fig:index2_cpuefit_WCGBTS}).  The fit to the Triennial Survey showsa noticeable change over time due to the separate catchability parameters estimated for the early and late periods (Figure \ref{fig:index2_cpuefit_Triennial}).

_Length Data._
The fits to the length data were reasonably good (Figures \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_aggregated_across_time}--\ref{fig:comp_lenfit__multi-fleet_comparison} and \ref{fig:mod1_1_comp_lenfit_flt1mkt2}--\ref{fig:mod1_4_comp_lenfit_flt6mkt0}). The observed length compositions for males in both the fishery and the WCGBT Survey is bimodal, with modes in the 80 cm and 115 cm length bins for the fishery, and in the 60 cm and 115 cm bins for the survey. The model expectation has modes in similar locations in both cases, where the first mode is close to the estimated peak selectivity value and the second is close to the estimated male L-infinity parameter. However, the second mode in the model expectation is less pronounced than in the observed data (Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_aggregated_across_time}). The residual patterns in the fit to the length compositions don't show strong patterns, with the WCGBT Survey data especially well fit. There are a few large residuals over a range of lengths in the early years as well as a few years where there were observations of small (under 50 cm) fish in the retained fishery catch which the model expected would have been discarded (Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit__multi-fleet_comparison}). The fit to the length data in alternative models that lacked either the growth cessation model or the sex-specific offsets to selectivity were less good (results not shown).

_Conditional Age-at-Length._
The conditional age-at-length data is likewise fit reasonably well, with some patterns in residuals showing variability among years, but no clear pattern that is consistent across years (Figures \ref{fig:age_fit_fishery} and \ref{fig:age_fit_WCGBTS}).

_Sex Ratios._
Sex ratio data is not included in the likelihood as such, but as a part of the length composition likelihood. The proportions of females and males are compiled into a single vector that is  compared to the model expectations in the multinomial likelihood. The patterns in sex ratio by length bin show fewer females than males for the middle range of sizes (70--120 cm), with a shift to almost 100% females for the largest size bins (over 130 cm). These patterns are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sexratio_len_flt1mkt2} and \ref{fig:sexratio_len_flt5mkt0}. The approximate uncertainty associated with the observed ratios is represented by a Jeffreys interval [@brown2001interval] based on the combination of the proportion of the lengths with each length bin and the adjusted input sample size. The use of sex-specific growth curves was adequate to fit the ratios for the largest bins, but ratio skews toward males at lengths where the mean ages are similar for females and males. The fit to this part of the sex ratio pattern required an offset in selectivity.

_Discards Rates and Mean Weight of the Discards._
Fit to the discard fraction estimates (Figure \ref{fig:discard_fitFishery}) and the mean weight of the discards (Figure \ref{fig:bodywt_fit_fltFishery}) show reasonably good fits. The model expectation is able to match the trend of decreasing discard fractions and decreasing mean weights over the years 2002--2010 by estimating an increasing trend in the asymptotic retention rate from 2004 to 2008 with a peak at close to 100%, followed by a decreasing trend from 2012 onward (Figures \ref{fig:sel09_len_flt1sex1} and \ref{fig:retention}). The years 2008--2012 with the highest asymptotic retention rates have little retention of large fish leading to lower discard rates and smaller mean weight of the discarded fish. The period from 2011 onward had observer coverage increased to 100% for the catch-shares trawl fishery, leading to more precise data and consistent patterns in the two data types. The first few years (which form the basis for the estimates going back to 1995), are more uncertain and less well fit, with the discard rates over 30% inconsistent with the mean weight under 1.5 kg in 2003 and 2004.


### Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Allowing all selectivity curves to be dome-shaped

  \item Removing the sex-specific offset on the selectivity curves
  
  \item Removing the prior on catchability for the WCGBT Survey
  
  \item Estimating a single catchability for all years in the Triennial Survey
  
  \item Estimating separate natural mortality parameters for males and females
  
  \item Removing the prior on natural mortality
  
  \item Using the von Bertalanffy growth model

  \item Using the Richards growth model

  \item Tuning the sample sizes using the McAllister-Ianelli method
  
  \item Estimating historic discards based on 3yr average of discard rates and landings
  
  \item Changing discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.4
  
  \item Changing discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.6

  \item Estimating multipliers on historical discards over blocks of time
  
\end{itemize}

Results of these sensitivities are shown in Figures \ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} to \ref{fig:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}, and Tables \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} to \ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}.

**Selectivity and catchability**

Allowing the selectivity for all fleets to be dome-shaped resulted in domed selectivity for all fleets, but only improved the total negative log-likelihood by 0.9 units, mostly through a slightly improved fit to the length compositions, although the fit to the surveys was slightly worse (Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}). Removing the offset between female and male selectivity caused the negative log-likelihood to be worse by 18.1 units, mostly through a worse fit to the length comps but also a worse fit to the conditional age-at-length compositions. The conditional age data was represented independently for each sex, so no sex-ratio information was present in the data, but the growth curves were changed slightly to compensate for the change in fit to the length data, resulting in a less good fit to the age data as well. The scale of the population remained somewhat similar to the base model under both of these sensitivities (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}).

Removing the prior on catchability for the WCGBT Survey had a large change in the estimated scale of the population, with the unfished equilibrium biomass increasing from the 2,224 mt estimated in the base model to 9,932 mt ("Q no prior on WCGBTS" in Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} and Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}). However, the change in likelihood was relatively small, with the total improving by 0.4 units, of which 0.04 was associated with the prior itself.

**Catch and discards**

The sensitivity analyses related to discard mortality resulted in little change in the scale of the population for any scenario (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_catch} and Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_catch}). Increasing or decreasing the discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.4 or 0.6 had the least impact, while the two alternative time series of discards caused the population to fall to a lower level around 1990 and increase faster in the recent period. The discards based on 3-yr average analysis simply used the alternative time series of historical discards described above and shown in Figure \ref{fig:discard_calculations}.

The sensitivity analysis in which multipliers on historical discards were estimated made use of the relatively new "catch multiplier" option in Stock Synthesis. Multiplier parameters controlling the ratio of the discards removed from the model relative to the input values were estimated for blocks of time covering the periods 1916--1949, 1950--1959, 1960--1969, 1970--1979, 1980--1989, and 1990--1994. These multiplier parameters were bounded to keep the input catch relative to the estimated total within the range 0.5--1.5 and a weak Beta prior distribution spawning this range was applied to the parameters to keep them from hitting the bounds and cause them to remain at 1.0 in the absence of information in the data.

The resulting pattern of historical discards shows a steadily increasing catch, with higher catch relative to the input values in all the blocks up to a peak in the 1980s, followed by an estimated decrease in the estimated catch for the 1990-1994 period (Figures \ref{fig:catch_multiplier_total_catch} and \ref{fig:catch_multiplier_catch_comparison}). These changes provide a greater contrast in the catch history, causing the estimated time series of spawning biomass to fall to a lower level and then increase faster from the 1990s onward, thus fitting the WCGBT Survey slightly better (Figures \ref{fig:Sensitivity_catch} and {fig:Sensitivity_catch2}). However, the improvement in likelihood for the survey was only 0.3 units (Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_catch}).

**Biology and data weighting**

The sensitivity analyses related to biology and data weighting included assumptions about natural mortality ($M$), growth, and data weighting (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc} and Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}). Allowing separate estimates of female and male natural mortality led to estimates of 0.475 for females and 0.395 for males, which are nearly symmetric around the 0.445 estimate of the shared mortality parameter in the base model. This difference allows more males to be present in the population and therefore better match the skewed sex ratios in the length composition data. The scale of the unfished equilibrium spawning biomass dropped to 61% of the base model estimate due to the smaller fraction of females living to mature with the higher $M$, but the estimate of total biomass in the unfished population remained at 91% of the base model (Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}). The improvement in likelihood is 2.2 units, which is modest given the extra parameter estimated. Additional explorations (not shown) indicated that a model with differential $M$ and no sex-specific offsets on the selectivity had much worse fit to the data than either the base model or this sensitivity analysis. Therefore, given that the differential selectivity provided a greater improvement in model fit than the sex-specific $M$, only the more influential factor was included in the base model.

Removing the prior on $M$ had little impact on the model with $M$ increasing from 0.445 in the base model to 0.448 without the prior.

The use of either von Bertalanffy [-@VonB] or Richards [-@richards1959flexible] growth models provided less good fits to both the conditional age-at-length and length data and higher estimated variability in length-at-age (Figure \ref{fig:growth_curve_comparison}). The increase in variability in length-at-age suggests that the model is using this variability to compensate for lack of fit to the mean length-at-age. The Richards model is a generalization of the von Bertalanffy growth model with an additional parameter allowing a more sigmoidal shape. For females, this additional parameter was hitting the lower bound of 0.1 resulting in linear growth up to age 20. This parameter on the bound led to a bad gradient and a non-positive-definite Hessian matrix, indicated that the model had not converged to the maximum likelihood estimates. In theory the additional parameter in the Richards model should allow it to always provide a better likelihood relative to the von Bertallanfy, but further attempts to search for a converged model with Richards growth has not yet been undertaken.

Tuning the sample sizes using the McAllister-Ianelli method had relatively small impact on the model results, with a lower weight given to the fishery lengths than the status-quo Francis tuning method, and a higher weight given to the WCGBT Survey lengths. The lengths from the Triennial Survey were given similar weight. Ages from both the fishery and the WCGBT Survey were increased in weight by a factor of 4.8 and 7.5, respectively. The likelihoods could not be compared due to these changes in the adjusted sample sizes, but the estimated parameters were all relatively similar to those in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio_and_misc}).

### Retrospective Analysis

Retrospective analyses, in which the final 5 years of data are successively removed from the model, showed relatively little change in the scale of the estimated population, but the uncertainty about the population size increased (Figure \ref{fig:retro}). The WCGBT Survey observations were underfit for the final 5 years, so removing these points, combined with a prior on catchability lowers the status of the stock, led to a slightly reduced estimated spawning biomass.

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted over the parameter controlling unfished equilibrium recruitment $log(R_0)$, catchability of the WCGBT Survey ($q$), stock-recruit steepness ($h$) and natural mortality ($M$). Results of these profiles are shown in Figures \ref{fig:profile_logR0} to \ref{fig:profile_M_compare1_spawnbio}. The contribution of different data sources to the changes in likelihood within the profiles were considered in the context of a change of less than 1.92 units of negative log-likelihood sometimes considered small based on half of the 95% quantile of a Chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom.

The profile over $log(R_0)$ shows that the change in likelihood over a broad range of values is relatively small compared to models with more contrast in the data, with a total change in likelihood of less than 4 units over a range of 8.2 to 9.6, corresponding to a range in equilibrium recruitment of 3.6 million to 14.8 million (the $log(R_0)$ parameter is the log of $R_0$ in thousands). Models with $log(R_0) < 8.2$ did not converge. The age data and discard data are best fit at the highest $R_0$ considered while the index and mean body weight data are best fit at the lowest $R_0$. Only the priors and the length data are best fit at intermediate values. The length data was best fit at $log(R_0) = 8.6$, while the separate components of the prior likelihood were also best fit at $log(R_0) = 8.6$ in the case of the prior on the catchability of the WCGBT Survey, and at $log(R_0) = 8.2$ in the case of the prior on natural mortality. The base model estimate balancing all these components was $log(R_0) = 8.728$. The spawning biomass estimates from the models in the profile were all relatively similar as a result of the models with higher $R_0$ also having a higher $M$ estimate, leading to a similar number of fish surviving to maturity (the range was $M = 0.526$ at $log(R_0) = 9.6$ to $M$ = 0.398$ at $log(R_0) = 8.2$).

The profile over catchability of the WCGBT Survey ($q$) provides a better illustration of the information in the data about the scale of the population, because the prior on $q$ is no longer influencing the estimates of all other parameters. The range considered for the parameter $log(q)$ corresponded to $q = 0.5$ to $q = 2.0$, where $q = 0.5$ has the observed survey biomass equal to half of the true population after accounting for selectivity of the survey, and $q = 2.0$ corresponds to the survey observations being double the true population. The likelihood contributions are represented here both without and with the prior likelihood (Figures \ref{fig:profile_logQ_noprior} and \ref{fig:profile_logQ}). The prior has a much stronger influence on the changes in likelihood over the range considered, with a total change of greater than 10 units of negative log-likelihood. The length data is the most influential of the other components, with a change of 2.6 units over the range of $q$ considered, with the best fit occuring at the smallest $q$ values. All three sources of length data were best fit at the lowest $q$ values with the fishery contributing 71% of the change, the WCGBT Survey 27% and the remaining %1 from the Triennial survey. The mean body weight data is also better fit at low $q$ while the indices and discard data are best fit at $q = 1.75$. The age data and the prior on natural mortality show very little change in likelihood over the range of $q$ considered (less than 0.1 unit of negative log-likelihood).

The spawning biomass estimated for the models included in the $q$ profile (Figure \ref{fig:profile_Q_compare1_spawnbio}) show similar trajectories, with the scale of the population negatively correlated with the $q$ values as expected.

The profile over steepness of the stock-recruit curve showed less than 0.8 units of likelihood over the range $h = 0.3$ to $h = 0.9$. The best fit occurred at $h = 0.5$, indicating that a model with steepness estimated would have been relatively similar to the base model where $h$ was fixed at 0.4. However, earlier model explorations indicated that models with $h$ estimated sometimes produced unstable results, where small changes in model configuration could cause the parameter to be estimated at either the upper or lower bound of the 0.2--1.0 range on which it's defined for the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curve.

The profile over natural mortality ($M$) showed that most of the information in the likelihood about $M$ was from the length and age data, with additional information in the discard rates and the mean body weight data. The prior on $M$ provided relatively little contribution to the total likelihood. The length data had the largest change in likelihood over the 0.25--0.55 range of $M$ considered, and was best fit at 0.45, close to the base model estimate of 0.445.

### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt.

The `r LastYR+1` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass 
is above the target of 40% of unfished levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_unfished_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, has been below the management target for the entire time series of the model (Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}).

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value of 0.4.
