## Previous Assessments

### History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock

No previous stock assessment has been conducted for Big Skate. The current management is based on an OFL estimate calculated from a proxy for $F_{MSY}$ and average survey biomass from the WCGBT Survey during the years 2010--2012 [@Taylor2013]. The $F_{MSY}$ estimate was based on the product of an assumed $F_{MSY}/M$ ratio and an $M$ estimate of 0.162 based on the maximum age of 26 reported by McFarlane and King [@McFarlane2006]. Values were sampled from an assumed distribution around all these quantities to develop a measure of uncertainty around the OFL estimate.

## Model Description

### Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas
Catch is divided among 4 fleets in the base model:
*Fishery (current)* combines all non-tribal sources of catch for the years 1995 onward,
*Discard (historical)* includes the estimated discard amount calculated from the estimated Longnose Skate discard rate as described above. The input catch for this fleet was 50% of the total estimate to account for the assumed 50% discard mortality rate.
*Fishery (historical)* includes the reconstructed landings estimates from each of the three states.
*Tribal* includes the estimates of catch of Big Skate by treaty tribes.


###Other Specifications

### Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.13 (@Methot2013, @Methot2019).
The r4ss package version 1.35.0 [@Taylor2019] was used to post-process the output data from Stock Synthesis.

### Data Weighting
The Francis [-@Francis2011] data weighting method "TA1.8" as implemented in the r4ss package was used for all length and age composition data.

### Priors
*Natural mortality*
The log-normal prior for female natural mortality was based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015], as described under "Natural Mortality." Male natural mortality was assumed equal to the values for females. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the impact of both the the prior and the assumption of equal natural mortality for both sexes.

*Survey catchability*
The lack of contrast in the data resulted in unstable model results under a variety of configurations. To keep biomass estimates within a plausibel range, a prior was applied to the catchability parameter ($q$) for the WCGBT Survey. This same prior was developed for the 2007 Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2007] and is being used for the current Longnose Skate assessment [@Gertseva2019]. The prior for the WCGBT Survey was derived as follows.

The WCGBT Survey covers the full latitudinal range of longnose skate modeled in the assessment, and thus, the latitudinal availability factor was assumed to be one (complete latitudinal coverage).  The survey coverage exceeds the maximum depth distribution of longnose skate but may not fully cover the shallow end of the skate distribution.  A range of 95 to 100 percent was assumed for the depth availability.  A range of 75 to 95 percent was assumed for vertical availability on the basis that longnose skate are known to bury in the mud and therefore some may be unavailable to the bottom trawl gear.  The largest bounds were placed on the probability of capture, given a fish is in the net path.  It is known that flatfish can be herded by trawl gear, and it is possible that this could also occur for skates.  However, it is also possible that skate could avoid the trawl nets.  For capture probability, a range of 75 to 150 percent was assumed.  Best estimates for each factors were set at the midpoint of the range for individual factors, except for the probability of capture, which was given a value of one. The overall estimate for the survey catchability was thus estimated to be 0.83 and the consequent bounds on catch, and the best assumption are: (0.53, 1.43) and 0.83 respectively. The best estimate was equated to the median of a lognormal distribution and the bounds to 99 percent of that distribution. This resulted in a normal prior on $log(q)$, with a mean of  -0.188, and standard deviation of 0.187.


### Estimated and Fixed Parameters
A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables 
\ref{tab:model_params}. 

The base model has a total of 44 estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 natural mortality parameter,
  \item 6 parameters related to female growth and the variability in length age age,
  \item 2 parameters related to male growth relative to female growth,
  \item 1 stock-recruit parameter ($log(R_0)$ controlling equilibrium recruitment)
  \item 3 catchability parameters (1 for the WCGBT Survey and 1 each for the early and late periods of the Triennial Survey)
  \item 2 extra standard deviation parameters (1 for each survey), and
  \item 29 selectivity parameters, including 16 related to time-varying retention rate
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and parameters is provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.

<!-- *********************MODEL 1 RESULTS********************************** -->
## Base Case Model Results 
The following description of the model results reflects a base model that 
incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel (see previous section). 
The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic standard errors 
are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are in 
Table \ref{tab:like_components}.  Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.



### Parameter Estimates

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys was estimated within the model.  



(Figure \ref{fig:ts11_Age-0_recruits_(1000s)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals} ). 

The stock-recruit curve ... Figure \ref{fig:SR_curve2} with estimated recruitments also 
shown. 

### Fits to the Data
Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length 
composition, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below.  


### Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Sensitivity 1
  
  \item Sensitivity 2
  
  \item Sensitivity 3
  
  \item Sensitivity 4
  
  \item Sensitivity 5, etc/
  
  
\end{enumerate}





### Retrospective Analysis



### Likelihood Profiles



### Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished 
level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt. 


(Figure \ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}

The `r LastYR` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass 
is above/below the target of 40% of unfished 
levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, has been xxx the management target 
for the entire time series of the model. 

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base 
model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value xxx.
