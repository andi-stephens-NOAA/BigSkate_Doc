Landings and estimated discards of Big Skate were reconstructed for this
assessment from historical records of other species and from species
composition data collected in the recent fishery. These reflect the
fishery from 1916-1994. The current fishery started in 1995. For records
from 1995-2017, Big Skate landings were estimated from
species-composition samples and the landings of ``Unspecified Skates''.
Beginning in 2017, Big Skate have been recorded in species-specific
landings.

(Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}).

(Figures \ref{fig:Exec_catch1}-\ref{fig:Exec_catch2})\\
(Figure \ref{fig:r4ss_catches})

In the current fishery (since 1995), annual total landings of Big Skate
have ranged between 135-528 mt, with landings in 2018 totaling 173 mt.

This the first full assessment for Big Skate, which was last assessed as
part of the ``Other Species'' complex. This assessment uses the newest
version of Stock Synthesis (3.30.13). The model begins in 1916, and
assumes the stock was at an unfished equilibrium that year.

(Figure \ref{fig:assess_region_map}).

(Figure \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} and Table

The 2018 estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium
spawning biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished spawning
biomass at 72.5\% (95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\) 55.2\%-89.7\%)
(Figure \ref{fig:RelDeplete_all}). Approximate confidence intervals
based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in
the estimated spawning biomass is high.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Reference Points}

This stock assessment estimates that Big Skate in the model is above the
biomass target (\(SB_{40\%}\)), and well above the minimum stock size
threshold (\(SB_{25\%}\)). The estimated relative depletion level for
the base model in 2019 is 72.5\% (95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\)
55.2\%-89.7\%, corresponding to an unfished spawning biomass of 1106.07
million eggs (95\% asymptotic interval: 504.33-1707.81 million eggs) of
spawning biomass in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).
Unfished age 1+ biomass was estimated to be 2,426 mt in the base case
model. The target spawning biomass (\(SB_{40\%}\)) is 610 million eggs,
which corresponds with an equilibrium yield of 558 mt. Equilibrium yield
at the proxy \(F_{MSY}\) harvest rate corresponding to \(SPR_{50\%}\) is
466 mt (Figure \ref{fig:Yield_all}).

\subsection{Distribution and Life
History}\label{distribution-and-life-history}}

Skates are the largest and most widely distributed group of batoid fish
with approximately 245 species ascribed to two families (Ebert and
Compagno (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2007}{2007}), McEachran and Miyake
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-McEachran1990}{1990})). Skates are benthic fish
that are found in all coastal waters but are most common in cold
temperatures and polar waters (Ebert and Compagno
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2007}{2007}).

There are eleven species of skates in three genera (Amblyraja,
Bathyraja, and Raja) present in the Northeast Pacific Ocean off
California, Oregon and Washington (Ebert 2003). Of that number, just
three species (Longnose Skate, \emph{Raja rhina}; Big Skate, \emph{Raja
binoculata}; and Sandpaper Skate, \emph{Bathyraja interrupta}) make up
over 95 percent of West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS)
catches in terms of biomass and numbers, with the Longnose Skate leading
in both categories (with 62 percent of biomass and 56 percent of
numbers).

Big Skate (\emph{Raja binoculata}) is the largest of the skate species
in North America with a documented maximum length of 244 cm total length
and a maximum weight of 91 kg (Eschmeyer and Herald
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eschmeyer1983}{1983}). The species name
``binoculata'' (two-eyed) refers to the prominent ocellus at the base of
each pectoral fin. Big Skates are usually seen buried in sediment with
only their eyes showing.

The Big Skate is most common in soft-sediment habitats in coastal waters
of the continental shelf (Bizzarro, JJ and Broms, KM and Logsdon, MG and
Ebert, DA and Yoklavich, MM and Kuhnz, LA and Summers, AP
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2014}{2014}), Farrugia et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})). Use of mixed substrate
(e.g., mud with boulders) increases with ontogeny but hard substrates
are largely avoided (Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). In the GOA, the Big Skate
is the most commonly encountered skate species in continental shelf
waters at 100--200 m depth, and is most abundant in the central and
western areas of the GOA (Stevenson, DE and Orr, JW and Hoff, GR and
McEachran, JD (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Stevenson2008}{2008}); Bizzarro,
JJ and Broms, KM and Logsdon, MG and Ebert, DA and Yoklavich, MM and
Kuhnz, LA and Summers, AP (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2014}{2014})).
Off the U.S. Pacific Coast, the Big Skate is most densely distributed on
the inner continental shelf (\textless{} 100 m; Bizzarro, JJ and Broms,
KM and Logsdon, MG and Ebert, DA and Yoklavich, MM and Kuhnz, LA and
Summers, AP (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2014}{2014})). Eggs are
mainly deposited between 70--90 m on sand or mud substrates (Hitz
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hitz1964}{1964}); NMFS-NWFSC-FRAM, unpub. data).
Juveniles typically occur in shallower waters than adults (Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). Core habitat regions of
Big Skate off the U.S. Pacific Coast and in the Gulf of Alaska are
spatially segregated from those of other species (Bizzarro, JJ and
Broms, KM and Logsdon, MG and Ebert, DA and Yoklavich, MM and Kuhnz, LA
and Summers, AP (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2014}{2014})).

Big Skates are highly mobile and capable of long range (\textgreater{}
2000 km) movements (KingandMcF2010; Farrugia et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})). For example, in British
Columbia, a study revealed that \textasciitilde{}75\% of tagged
individuals were recaptured within 21 km of the tagging locations, but
15 of the tagged individuals (0.1\%) moved over 1,000 km (max = 2340 km;
King, JR and McFarlane, GA
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-KingandMcF2010}{2010})). In the Gulf of Alaska,
a year of satellite tag data showed that six of twelve tagged
individuals moved over 100 km, with one skate moving \textgreater{}
2,000 km (Farrugia et al.~2016). Although primarily benthic, Big Skates
utilize the entire water column including surface waters (Farrugia et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})). They have broad
thermal tolerances 2--19Âº C that enable their occurrence from boreal to
subtropical latitudes (Love, Milton S
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}); Farrugia et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})).

Big Skates are opportunistic, generalist mesopredators with highly
variable spatio-temporal trophic roles (Ebert and Compagno
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2007}{2007}); Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). Off central California,
diet of Big Skates is composed mainly of fishes, shrimps, and crabs (in
descending order), with larger skates incorporating more fishes
(({\textbf{???}})); however, in the Gulf of Alaska, Big Skate diet
consists mainly of crabs (esp.~Tanner Crabs) throughout ontogeny, with
relatively small portions of fishes and shrimps (Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). Correspondingly, trophic
level and general diet composition estimates differ significantly
between California and Gulf of Alaska Big Skate populations (Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})).

Big Skates and their egg cases are preyed upon by a variety of
vertebrates and invertebrates. Snails and other molluscs bore holes in
egg cases to feed on developing embryos and especially their protein
rich yolk-sacs (Bizzarro, pers. obs; Hoff, GR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hoff2009}{2009})). Sevengill Sharks, Brown
Rockfish, and Stellar Sea Lions are known predators of juvenile and
adult Big Skates (Ebert (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2003}{2003}), Love,
Milton S (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011})). Northern Sea Lions
consume free-living Big Skates and their egg cases (Ebert
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2003}{2003}), Love, Milton S
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011})).

In 2012, the Big Skate was moved from genus \emph{Raja} to the new genus
\emph{Beringraja} together with the Mottled Skate (\emph{B. pulchra})
(Ishihara et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ishihara2012}{2012}). These are
the only two skates with multiple embryos per egg case, and they are
very similar mophologically and genetically (Bizzarro, J.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2019}{2019}).

\subsection{Biology}\label{biology}}

The Big Skate is broadly distributed, occurring from the southeastern
Bering Sea (Mecklenburg, CW and Mecklenburg, TA and Thorsteinson, LK
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mecklenburg2002}{2002}) to southern Baja
California (22.90Âº N, 110.03Âº W; (Castro-Aguirre et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Castro1993}{1993})) and the Gulf of California
(Castro-Aguirre and PÃ©rez \protect\hyperlink{ref-Castro1996}{1996}). It
has been reported at depths of 2--501 m (min: Miller et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller1980}{1980}); max: Farrugia et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})) but is most common on the
inner continental shelf (\textless{} 100 m; (Love, Milton S
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}); (Bizzarro
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). Big Skates are highly
mobile and capable of long range (\textgreater{} 2000 km) movements
((King and McFarlane \protect\hyperlink{ref-KingandMcF2009}{2009});
(Farrugia et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})).

Big Skate is oviparious, and is one of two skate species that have
multiple embryos per egg case (Ebert et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2008}{2008}). From 1--8 embryos can be
contained in a single, large egg capsule, but most have 3--4 (DeLacy and

\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hitz1964}{1964}, Ford
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ford1971}{1971}). Eggs are deposited year-round
on sand or mud substrates at depths of \textasciitilde{}50--150 m (Hitz
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hitz1964}{1964}, Ebert and Compagno
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2007}{2007}). Embryos hatch from eggs after
6--20 months, with shorter developmental periods associated with warmer
temperatures (Hoff, GR \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hoff2009}{2009}). In
captivity, Big Skate females may produce \textgreater{} 350 eggs/year
(average of 2 embryos/egg case; Chiquillo, Kelcie L and Ebert, David A
and Slager, Christina J and Crow, Karen D
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chiquillo2014}{2014})) from long-term sperm
storage ({\textbf{???}}). Size at birth is 18--23 cm TL (Ebert
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2003}{2003}). Maximum size is 244 cm TL
{[}Eschmeyer and Herald (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eschmeyer1983}{1983}),
with females growing to larger sizes.

Size at maturity has been variably estimated for Big Skate populations
off California, British Columbia, and Alaska. Off central California,
Zeiner and Wolf ({\textbf{???}}) reported sizes at first maturity of
\textasciitilde{}129 cm TL (females) and \textasciitilde{}100 cm TL
(males). A similar size at maturity was estimated for females from the
Gulf of Alaska (first = 126 cm TL, 50\% = 149 cm TL), but male estimates
were considerably greater (first = 124 cm TL, 50\% = 119 cm TL; Ebert et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2008}{2008})). Much smaller sizes at
first (female = 60 cm TL, male = 50 cm TL) and 50\% (female = 90 cm TL,
male = 72 cm TL) maturity were generated for the Longnose Skate
populations off British Columbia ({\textbf{???}}); however, maturity
evaluation criteria were flawed (subadults were considered to be
mature), and these results are therefore not considered valid.

Age and growth parameters have been established from California, British
Columbia, and the Gulf of Alaska. Maximum ages off central California
(females = 12, males = 11; ({\textbf{???}})) and in the Gulf of Alaska
(females = 14, males = 15; Gburski et al.~2007) were similar, but
estimates off British Columbia were much greater (females = 26, males =
25; McFarlane and King 2006). It is important to note that age estimates
are based on an unvalidated method and geographic differences in size or
age may reflect differences in sampling or ageing criteria. In the Gulf
of Alaska, Big Skates reach 50\% maturity at 10 years and 7 years for
females and males, respectively (({\textbf{???}}), Ebert et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2008}{2008})). Generation length estimates
range from 11.5 ({\textbf{???}}) to 17 years ({\textbf{???}}).

In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly
included in the analysis. This is primarily due to a lack of relevant
data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) that could contribute
ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.

\hypertarget{fishery-information}{%
\subsection{Fishery Information}\label{fishery-information}}

Big Skate are caught in commercial and recreational fisheries on the
West Coast using line and trawl gears. There is a limited market for
pectoral fins (skate wings).

The history of Big Skate is not well documented. They were used as a
food source by the native Coastal and Salish Tribes (Batdorf, C
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Batdorf1990}{1990}) long before Europeans settled
in the Pacific Northwest and then as fertilizer by the settlers (Bowers,
G. M. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bowers1909}{1909}). No directed fishery for
Big Skate has been documented; rather, they were taken along with other
skates and rays as ``scrap fish'' and used for fertilizer, fish meal and
oil ({\textbf{???}}).

Skates have been regarded as a predator on desirable market species such
as Dungeness crab, and were thought of as nuisance fish with no appeal
as a food item save for small local markets. They had been discarded or
harvested at a minimal level until their livers became valued along with
those of other cartilaginous fishes for the extraction of vitamin A in
the 1940s. Chapman (Chapman, W.M.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapman1944}{1944}) recorded that ``At present
they are being fished heavily, in common with the other elasmobranchs of
the coast, forthe vitamins in their livers. The carcasses are either
thrown away at sea or made into fish meal. Little use is made of the
excellent meat of the wings''.

Little information is available about the historic Washington fishery
for Big Skate. In records before 2000, they are lumped together with
other skates or in market categories ({\textbf{???}}); this necessitates
considerable attention to reconstructing the fishery by observing the
composition of skate catches in the modern fishery and applying those to
the recently reconstructed historical records.

Very little information is known about the Big Skate historical fishery
in Oregon. The information we do have is mainly from historical landing
data and species composition samples starting in the mid-nineties. The
bulk of the catch is from the bottom trawl and longline fisheries, with
smaller amounts as by-catch in mid-water trawl and the shrimp trawl
fishery. Big Skate was lumped into the nominal ``Skate'' category until
2015 when it was separated into its own market category. Species
composition data have been vitally important in reconstructing the
pre-2015 historical catch ({\textbf{???}}).

\hypertarget{stock-status-and-management-history}{%
\subsection{Stock Status and Management
History}\label{stock-status-and-management-history}}

Big Skate were managed in the ``Other Fish'' complex until 2015 when
they were designated an Ecosystem Component (EC) species. Catches of Big
Skate are estimated to have averaged 95 mt from 2007--2011, along with
large landings of ``Unspecified Skate''. Analysis of Oregon
port-sampling data indicates that about 98 percent of the recent
Unspecified Skate landings in Oregon were comprised of Big Skate. Such
large landings indicates targeting of Big Skate has occurred and an EC
designation was not warranted. Based on this evidence, Big Skate was
redesignated as an actively-managed species in the fishery. Big skate
have been managed with stock-specific harvest specifications since 2017.

The recent OFL of 541 mt was calculated by applying approximate MSY
harvest rates toestimates of stock biomass from the Northwest Fisheries
Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey. This
survey-based biomass estimate is likely underestimated since Big Skate
are distributed all the way to the shoreline and no West Coast trawl
surveys have been conducted in water shallower than 55 meters. This
introduces an extra source of uncertainty to management and suggests
that increased precaution is needed to reduce the risk of overfishing
the stock.

There has been consideration for managing Big Skate in a complex with
Longnose Skate, the other actively-managed West Coast skate species, but
the two species have disparate distributions and fishery interactions
(Longnose Skate is much more deeply distributed than Big Skate) and that
option was not endorsed. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has
chosen to set the Annual Catch Limit (ACL) equal to the Allowable
Biological Catch (ABC) with a buffer for management uncertainty (P*) of
0.45.

** Alaska **

In Alaska, skates were primarily taken as bycatch in both longline and
trawl fisheries until 2003, when a directed skate fishery developed in
the Gulf of Alaska, where Longnose and Big skates comprise the majority
of the skate biomass.

The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) skate complex is managed as three units. Big
skates and Longnose Skates each have separate harvest specifications,
with acceptable biological catches (ABCs) specified for each GOA
regulatory area (western, central, and eastern). A single gulfwide
overfishing level (OFL) is specified for each stock. All remaining skate
species are managed as an ``Other Skates'' group with gulfwide harvest
specifications. All GOA skates are managed as Tier 5 stocks, where OFL
and ABC are based on survey biomass estimates and natural mortality rate
(Alaska Fisheries Science Center
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AFSC2018}{2018}).

In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, skates are assessed as a group
rather than as separate species.

** Canada **

In Canada historic information regarding skate catches goes back to the
1950's. Prior to 1990's skates were taken mostly as bycatch and landings
were reported as part of a skate complex (not by species). As with the
West Coast, the trawl fishery is responsible for the largest amount of
bycatch. Skate catches off British Columbia accelerated in the early
1990's, partly due to emerging Asian markets. Since 1996, longnose skate
has been targeted by the B.C. trawl fishery and, as a result, catches
have been more accurately reported.

Assessments of Longnose Skate and Big Skate were conducted by Canada's
Division of Fisheries and Oceans in 2015(King, J.R., Surry, A.M.,
Garcia, S., and P.J. Starr \protect\hyperlink{ref-King2015}{2015}). For
Big Skate, a Bayesian surplus production model failed to provide
plausible results, and two data-limited approaches were investigated:
Depletion-Corrected Average Catch Analysis (DCAC), and a Catch-MSY
(maximum sustainable yield) Approach.

DCAC produced a range of potential yield estimates that were above the
long-term average catch, with an upper bound that was three orders of
magnitude larger than the long-term average catch. The Catch-MSY
approach was found to be quite sensitive to assumptions and was not
recommended as the sole basis of advice to managers.

The recommendation for managment for both skate species was that they
should be managed with harvest yeilds based on mean historic catch, with
consideration given to survey trends and to the ranges of maximum
sustainable yield estimates identified by the Catch-MSY Approach.
However, the analysis found no significant trends in abundance indices
for Big Skate, and mean historical catches were below the maximum MSY
estimate from the catch-MSY results.

\textbf{\(\color{red}{\text{Washington Commercial Skate Landings Reconstruction}}\)}

Information for Big Skate is very limited, in part because the
requirement to sort landings of Big Skate in the shore-based Individual
Fishing Quota fishery from landings in the ``Unidentified Skate''
category was not implemented until June 2015. The historical catch of
Big Skate therefore relies on the historical reconstruction of Longnose
Skate.

For the 2019 assessment, a new approach has been developed for
estimating the catch history for Longnose Skate based on a linear
regression model that predicts the catch of Longnose Skate from the
catch of Dover sole, for which historical catch estimates are available
(Gertseva, V. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2019}{2019}). The dependent
variable for the linear regression model was the West Coast Groundfish
Observer Program (WCGOP) annual estimates of the coastwide total catch
(landings plus discards) of Longnose Skate for the period 2009 to 2017
and the independent variable was the corresponding WCGOP annual
estimates of coastwide total catch (landings plus discards) of Dover
sole. The regression model has good predictive power
(R\textsuperscript{2} = 95.7\%) over the range of the Dover sole catches
(6,500 to 12,500 mt).

The discard component of the catch reconstruction for Big Skate may be
based either on the catch reconstruction for Longnose Skate and the
assumption that the two species experience similar discard rates
(discard / total catch) or on a similar analysis with links to species
that co-occur with big skate. Data from the Pikitch discard study
(1985-1987) and from WCGOP (2015-2017) support the idea that discard
rates for the two species are very similar. Also, market demand for
skates does not seem to distinguish between the two species. There are
insufficient years of data from the WCGOP to develop a regression model
for Big Skate as was done for Longnose Skate.

\textbf{Oregon Commercial Skate Landings Reconstruction}

Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) provided newly
reconstructed commercial landings for all observed skate species for the
2019 assessment cycle (1978 -- 2018). In addition, the methods were
reviewed at a pre-assessment workshop. Historically, skates were landed
as a single skate complex in Oregon. In 2009, longnose skates were
separated into their own single-species landing category, and in 2014,
big skates were also separated. The reconstruction methodology differed
by these three time blocks in which species composition collections
diverged (1978 -- 2008; 2009 -- 2014; 2015 -- 2018).

Species compositions of skate complexes from commercial port sampling
are available throughout this time period but are generally limited,
which precluded the use of all strata for reconstructing landings.
Quarter and port were excluded, retaining gear type, PMFC area, and
market category for stratifying reconstructed landings within the three
time blocks. Bottom trawl gear types include multiple bottom trawl
gears, and account for greater than 98\% of skate landings . Minor gear
types include primarily bottom longline gear, but also include mid-water
trawl, hook and line, shrimp trawl, pot gear and scallop dredge.

For bottom trawl gears, trawl logbook areas and adjusted skate catches
were matched with strata-specific species compositions. In Time Block 1
(1978 -- 2008), all bottom trawl gear types were aggregated due to a
lack of specificity in the gear recorded on the fish tickets. However,
in Time Blocks 2 and 3, individual bottom trawl gear types were
retained. Some borrowing of species compositions was required (31\% of
strata) and when necessary, borrowed from the closest area or from the
most similar gear type . Longline gear landings were reconstructed in a
similar fashion as to bottom trawl and required some borrowing among
strata as well (25\%).

Due to insufficient species compositions, mid-water trawl landings were
reconstructed using a novel depth-based approach. Available compositions
indicate that the proportion by weight of big skates within a
composition drops to zero at approximately 100 fathoms, and an inverse
relationship is observed for longnose skate, where the proportion by
weight is consistently one beyond 100 -- 150 fathoms . Complex-level
landings were assigned a depth from logbook entries and these species
specific depth associations were used to parse out landings by species.
The approach differed somewhat by time block . Landings from shrimp
trawls were handled using a similar methodology. Finally, very minor
landings from hook and line, pot gear and scallop dredges were assigned
a single aggregated species composition, as they lack any gear-specific
composition samples. Landings from within a time block were apportioned
by year using the proportion of the annual ticket landings.

Results indicate that the species-specific landings from this
reconstruction are very similar to those from Oregon's commercial catch
reconstruction (Karnowski et al.~2014) during the overlapping years but
cover a greater time period with methodology more applicable to skates
in particular. ODFW intends to incorporate reconstructed skate landings
into PacFIN in the future (A. Whitman, ODFW; pers. comm.).

\textbf{California Catch Reconstruction}

A reconstruction of historical skate landings from California waters was
developed for the 1916--2017 time period using a combination of
commercial catch data (spatially explicit block summary catches and port
sample data from 2009-2017) and fishery-independent survey data
(Bizzarro, J. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2019}{2019}). Virtually all
landings in California were of ``unspecified skate'' until
species-composition sampling of skate market categories began in 2009.

From 2009 through 2017, catch estimates were based on these market
category species-composition samples, and the average of those
species-compositions was hindcast to 2002, based on the assumption that
those data were representative of the era of large area closures in the
post-2000 period.

For the period from 1936-1980, spatially explicit landings data (the
California Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (CDFW) block summary
data) were merged with survey data to provide species-specific
estimates.

For years 1981-2001, a ``blended'' product of these two approaches was
taken, in which a linear weighting scheme blended the two sets of catch
estimates through that period. Landings estimates were also scaled
upwards by an expansion factor for skates landed as ``dressed'' based on
fish ticket data. Prior to 1981 these data had not been reported and
skate landings were scaled by the ``average'' percentage landed as
dressed in the 1981-1985 time period, but by the late 1980s nearly all
skates were landed round.

As no spatial information on catch is available from 1916-1930, and the
block summary data were very sparse in the first few years of the CDFW
fish ticket program (1931--1934), spatial information from the late
1930's was used to hindcast to the 1916--1935 time period.

\subsubsection{Tribal Catch in
Washington}\label{tribal-catch-in-washington}}

\hypertarget{commercial-discards}{%
\subsubsection{Commercial Discards}\label{commercial-discards}}

Commercial discards of Big Skate are highly uncertain. The method used
to estimate discards for Longnose Skate was based on a strong
correlation between total mortality of that species, and total mortality
of Dover Sole for the years 2009--2017 during which Longnose were landed
separately from other skates. In contrast, the sorting requirement for
Big Skate occurred too recently to provide an adequate range of years
for this type of correlation. Furthermore, there is greater uncertainty
in the total mortality for the shallow-water species with which Big
Skate most often co-occurs, such as Sand Sole and Starry Flounder, than
there is for Dover Sole, which has been the subject of recurring stock
assessments.

However, those involved in the fishery for both skate species report
that discarding for Big Skate and Longnose Skate in the years prior to
1995 were driven by the same market forced and the discard rates were
similar. primarily lack of margets or fish processors accepting only
skate wings that had been separated at-sea, as well as the quantitative
have more uncertainty in their own catch estimates have no stock
assessment and more uncertain mortality estimated total mortality and
Dover Sole for which a correlation between relationship (Gertseva, V.

\textbf{Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) Triennial Shelf Survey}\\
Research surveys have been used since the 1970s to provide
fishery-independent information about the abundance, distribution, and
biological characteristics of Big Skate. A coast-wide survey was
conducted in 1977 (Gunderson, Donald Raymond and Sample, Terrance M.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gunderson1980}{1980}) by the Alaska Fisheries
Science Center, and repeated every three years through 2001. The final
year of this survey, 2004, was conducted by the NWFSC according to the
AFSC protocol. We refer to this as the \textbf{Triennial Survey}.

The survey design used equally-spaced transects from which searches for
tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The depth range and
latitudinal range was not consistent across years, but all years in the
period 1980-2004 included the area from 40\(^\circ\) 10'N north to the
Canadian border and a depth range that included 55-366 meters, which
spans the range where the vast majority of Big Skate encountered in all
trawl surveys. Therefore the index was based on this depth range. The
survey as conducted in 1977 had incomplete coverage and is not believe
to be comparable to the later years, and is not used in the index.

An index of abundance was estimated based on the VAST delta-GLMM model
as described for the NWFSC Combo Index above. In this case as well, Q-Q
plots indicated slightly better performance of the gamma over lognormal
models for positive tows (Figure \ref{fig:VAST_QQ}).

\textbf{Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom
Trawl Survey}

In 2003, the NWFSC took over an ongoing slope survey the AFSC had been
conducting, and expanded it spatially to include the continental shelf.
This survey, referred to in this document as the \textbf{NWFSC Combo
Survey}, has been conducted annually since. It uses a random-grid design
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m from
late-May to early-October (Bradburn, M.J. and Keller, A.A and Horness,
B.H. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bradburn2011}{2011} , Keller, A.A. and
Wallace, J.R. and Methot, R.D.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Keller2017}{2017}). Four chartered industry
vessels are used each year (with the exception of 2013 when the U.S.
federal-government shutdown curtailed the survey). Yellowtail catches in
the NWFSC Combo Survey are shown in \ref{fig:assess_region_map2}.

The data from the NWFSC Combo survey was analyzed using a
spatio-temporal delta-model (Thorson, J. T. and Shelton, A. O. and Ward,
E. J. and Skaug, H. J. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorson2015}{2015}),
implemented as an R package VAST (Thorson, James T. and Barnett, Lewis
A. K. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorson2017a}{2017}) and publicly available
online (\url{https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST}). Spatial and
spatio-temporal variation is specifically included in both encounter
probability and positive catch rates, a logit-link for encounter
probability, and a log-link for positive catch rates. Vessel-year
effects were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in
the database.

\textbf{Internation Pacific Halibut Commission Longline Survey}

The IPHC has conducted an annual longline survey for Pacific Halibut off
the coast of Oregon and Washington since 1997 (no surveys were performed
in 1998 or 2000). Beginning in 1999, this has been a fixed station
design, with 84 locations in this area (station locations differed in
1997, and are therefore not comparable with subsequent surveys). 400 to
800 hooks have been deployed at each station in 100-hook groups
(typically called ``skates'' although that term will be avoided here to
avoid confusion). The gear used to conduct the survey was designed to
efficiently sample Pacific Halibut and used 16/0 (\#3) circle hooks
baited with Chum Salmon.

In some years from 2011 onward, additional stations were added to the
survey to sample Yelloweye Rockfish. These stations were excluded from
the analysis, as were additional stations added in 2013, 2014, and 2017,
off the coast of California (south of 42 degrees latitude). Some
variability in exact sampling location is practically unavoidable, and
leeway is given in the IPHC methods to center the set on the target
coordinates while allowing wind and currents to dictate the actual
direction in which the gear is deployed. This can result in different
habitats being accessed at each fixed deployment location across years.
One station that was very close to the U.S. Canada border had the
mid-point of the set in Canada in 2 out of the 19 years of the survey.
For consistency among years, all samples from this station were included
in the analysis, including those in Canada.

In most years, bycatch of non-halibut species has been recorded during
this survey on the first 20 hooks of each 100-hook group, although in
2003 only 10\% of the hooks were observed for bycatch, and starting in
2012, some stations had 100\% of the hooks observed for bycatch.
Combining these observation pattern with the number of hooks deployed
each year, resulted in most stations having 80, 100, 120, 140, or 160
hooks observed, with a mean of 144 hooks and a maximum of 800 hooks
observed. The depth range of the 84 stations considered was 42---530 m,
thus extending beyond the range of Big Skate, but 74\% of the stations
were shallower than 200 m. Big Skate have been observed at 51 of the 84
the standard stations that were retained for this analysis, but no
station had Big Skates observed in more than 12 out of the 19 years of
survey data, and only 10\% of the station/year combinations had at least
one observed Big Skate (Figure X). Of those station/year combinations
with at least one Big Skate observed, the Big Skates were observed on an
average of 1.3\% of the hooks observed. The highest proportion was 10
Big Skates out of 81 hooks observed at one station.

The IPHC longline survey catch data were standardized using a
Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with binomial error structure.
Catch-per-hook was modeled, rather than catch per station due to the
variability in the number of hooks deployed and observed each year. The
binomial error structure was considered logical, given the binary nature
of capturing (or not) a Longnose Skate on each longline hook. The
modeling approach is identical to that which has been applied in the
past for Yelloweye Rockfish (\emph{Stewart et al.~2009}), and Spiny
Dogfish (\emph{Gertseva et al., 2011}). MCMC sampling of the GLM
parameters was used to estimate the variability around each index
estimate. The median index estimates themselves were approximately equal
to the observed mean catch rate in each year (Figure Y). In recent
years, the IPHC standardization of the index of halibut abundance has
included an adjustment to account for missing baits on hooks returned
empty in an effort to account for reduced catchability of the gear that
may result from the lost bait. This adjustment was not included in the
analysis for Big Skate although it could be considered in future years.

The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet
is in Figure \ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time}. Descriptions
and details of the length composition data are in the above section for
each fleet or survey.

\textbf{Age Structures}

von Bertalanffy growth curve (von Bertalanffy, L
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vonBertalanffy1938}{1938}),
\(L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}\), where \(L_i\) is the length (cm) at
age \(i\), \(t\) is age in years, \(k\) is rate of increase in growth,
\(t_0\) is the intercept, and \(L_{\infty}\) is the asymptotic length.

Ages WCGBTS Currently only 333 ages from 2010 present in data warehouse
as of Apr 15 Patrick submitting an 300 additional ages from 2016 and
2017 to Beth on Apr 2 and promised further additions during the week of
Apr 15.

Triennial Survey No ages

Commercial fisheries 2009 samples from WA were stratified by length, so
should be treated as conditionals

\textbf{Aging Precision and Bias}

\textbf{Weight-Length}

Estimated by Ian based on WCGBT samples (n = 1159)
\(Weight = 0.0000074924 * Length ^ 2.9925\) (Figure
\ref{fig:weight-length}).

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Sex Ratio, Maturity, and Fecundity}

The female maturity relationship was based on visual maturity estimates
from port samplers (n = 278, of which 241 were from Oregon and 37 from
Washington, with 24 mature specimens) as well as 55 samples from the
WCGBTS (of which 4 were mature). The resulting relationship was
\(L_{50\%} = 148.2453\) with a slope parameter of \(Beta = -0.13155\) in
the relationship \(M = (1 + Beta(L - L_{50\%}))^{-1}\) (Figure
\ref{fig:maturity}).

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Natural Mortality}

The Hamel prior for M is lognormal(ln(5.4/max age),.438), which based on
1 age-15 fish out of 1034 observed in the WCGBTS results in lognormal(
-1.021651, 0.438)

If it needs to be fixed, it should be set to M = 5.4/max age = 5.4/15 =
0.36

In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations
were explicitly included in the analysis. This is primarily due to a
lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) that
could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the
assessment.

Deriving estimates of OFL for species in the ``Other Fish'' complex or
potential alternative complexes

The current ``Other Fish'' complex and proposed alternatives include a
number of species for which estimates of OFL contributions are not
available from stock assessments or data-poor methods. Four of the
species had OFL contributions for the 2013--2014 management cycle
calculated by applying approximate MSY harvest rates to estimates of
stock biomass from the NWFSC West Coast Bottom Trawl Survey (Bradburn et
al., 2012). This approach is described in detail in Cope et al.~(2012).

The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.30.05.03 by Dr.~Richard
Methot at the NWFSC. This most recent version was used, since it
included improvements and corrections to older versions. The r4SS
package (GitHub release number v1.27.0) was used to post-processing
output data from Stock Synthesis.

\hypertarget{priors}{%
\subsubsection{Priors}\label{priors}}

The log-normal prior for female natural mortality were based on a
meta-analysis completed by Hamel
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hamel2015}{2015}), as described under ``Natural
Mortality.'' Female natural mortality was fixed at the median of the
prior, 0.xxx for an assumed maximum age of xx. An uninformative prior
was used for the male offset natural mortality, which was estimated.

The prior for steepness (\emph{h}) assumes a beta distribution with
parameters based on an update for the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (Dorn,
M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.), which was endorsed by the Science and
Statistical Committee in 2018. The prior is a beta distribution with
\(mu\)=0.xxx and \(sigma\)=0.xxx. Steepness is fixed in the base model
at the mean of the prior. The priors were applied in sensitivity
analyses where these parameters were estimated.

\subsection{Base Case Model Results}\label{base-case-model-results}}

The following description of the model results reflects a base model
that incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel (see
previous section). The base model parameter estimates and their
approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table
\ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are in Table
\ref{tab:like_components}. Estimates of derived reference points and
approximate 95\% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table
\ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}. Time-series of estimated stock size over time
are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

\hypertarget{parameter-estimates}{%
\subsubsection{Parameter Estimates}\label{parameter-estimates}}

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each
year's input variability) for all surveys was estimated within the
model.

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and
catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model,
(2017). Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) were 466 mt
when using an \(SPR_{50\%}\) reference harvest rate and with a 95\%
confidence interval of 303 mt based on estimates of uncertainty. The
spawning biomass equivalent to 40\% of the unfished level
(\(SB_{40\%}\)) was 610 mt.

(Figure
\ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}

The 2018 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning
biomass is above/below the target of 40\% of unfished levels (Figure
\ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}).
The relative fishing intensity, \((1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})\), has been xxx
the management target for the entire time series of the model.

points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows
