This assessment reports the status of the Big Skate
(\emph{Beringraja binoculata}) resource in U.S. waters off the West
Coast using data through 2018. A map showing the area of the U.S. West

The majority of Big Skate catch was discarded prior to 1995 when markets
for Big Skate and Longnose Skate developed, landings increased, and
discarding decreased. The majority of the discards were unrecorded and
the landings were in the unspecified skates category. The landings from
prior to 1995 were reconstructed separately in each of the three coastal
states for this assessment. In general the methods all relied on
differences in depth distribution of the different skates species
(primarily Big Skate and Longnose Skate). Discards during this period
prior to 1995 were estimated outside the model based on an assumption
that the average discard rate during the period 1950--1994 was equal to
that for Longnose Skate. The current fishery, beginning in 1995, has
less uncertainty in landings, lower discard rates, and more data on
discards. The discards are estimated within the model for this period
using a time-varying retention function. Big Skate have only been landed
in their own species category in the past few years (starting in 2015).

In the current fishery (since 1995), annual total landings of Big Skate
have ranged between 135-528 mt, with landings in 2018 totaling 173 mt.

\subsection*{Data and Assessment}\label{data-and-assessment}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data and Assessment}

This the first full assessment for Big Skate. It is currently managed
using an OFL which was based on a proxy for \(F_{MSY}\) and the average
survey biomass for the years 2010--2012. This assessment uses the newest
version of Stock Synthesis (3.30.13.02). The model begins in 1916, and
assumes the stock was at an unfished equilibrium that year. The choice
of 1916 is based on the first year of the Califonia catch
reconstruction.

The assessment relies on two bottom trawl survey indices of abundance,
the Triennial Survey from which an index covering the period 1980--2004
was used here and the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) Survey,
which began in 2003 and for which data is available through 2018. The
triennial survey shows an increasing trend over the 25 year period it
covers, which the model is not able to fit as this includes the period
when trawl fishing in this area was at its most intense and the stock
would is expected to have been declining. The WCGBT Survey also shows an
increasing trend, with the 5 most recent observations (2014--2018) all
falling in the top 6 ever observed (2004 was the 5th highest
observation). The model estimates an increasing trend during this period
but the slope is more gradual than the trend in the survey observations.
The misfit to these survey indices could be due to some combination of
incorrect estimation of the catch history, variability in recruitment
which is not modeled here, or biological or ecological changes which are
not modeled.

Length composition data from the fishery is available starting in 1995
but is sparse until the most recent 10 years. Most of the ages are also
from 2008 onward. This limits the ability of the model to estimate any
changes in composition of the population during the majority of the
history of the fishery. Estimates of discard rates and mean body weight
of discards are available for the years 2002 onward and discard length
compositions are available starting in 2010.

The age and length data provide evidence for growth patterns and
sex-specific differences in selectivity that are unusual among
groundfish stocks that have been assessed within the U.S. West Coast and
are not found in Longnose Skate, where the data show little difference
between the sexes. Growth appears to be almost linear and similar
between females and males up to about age 7 or over 100 cm at which
point male growth appears to stabilize while females continue to grow.
However, in spite of the similar growth pattern for ages prior to 7,
males are observed more frequently in the length bins associated with
these ages, with the 70--100 cm length bins showing more than 60\% males
in many years. Sex-specific differences in selectivity were included in
the model in order to better match patterns in the sex ratios in the
length composition data and a new ``growth cessation model'' was used to
model growth as it provided much better fits than the von Bertalanffy
growth function. The length and age data do not cover enough years or
show enough evidence of distinct cohorts to reliably estimate deviations
in recruitment around the stock-recruit curve, so recruitment in the
final model is based directly on the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curve.
Steepness of this stock-recruit curve was not well-informed by the model
so was fixed at the value used in a previous Longnose Skate stock
assessment (Gertseva, V and Schirippa, MJ
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2007}{2007}).

The final model has 44 estimated parameters, most of which are related
to selectivity (including sex-specific differences), time-varying
retention, and growth (including sex-specific differences). The
remaining 7 parameters include natural mortality, equilibrium
recruitment, an extra survey uncertainty parameter for each of the two
surveys, and three catchability parameters, where the Triennial Survey
is assumed to have a change in catchability starting in 1995 due to
changes in survey design.

The scale of the population is not reliably informed by the data due to
the combination of surveys that show trends which can't be matched by
the structure of the model, and length and age data which inform growth
and selectivity but provide relatively little information about changes
in stock structure over time. Therefore, a prior on catchability of the
WCGBT Survey (centered at 0.83) was applied in order to provide more
stable results.

Although the assessment model requires numerous simplifying assumptions,
it represents an improvement over the simplistic status-quo method of
setting management limits, which relies on average survey biomass and an
assumption about \(F_{MSY}\). The use of an age-structured model with
estimated growth, selectivity, and natural mortality likely provides a
better estimate of past dynamics and the impacts of fishing in the
future.

\hypertarget{stock-biomass}{%
\subsection*{Stock Biomass}\label{stock-biomass}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stock Biomass}

The 2018 estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium
spawning biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished spawning
biomass at 79.2\% (95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\) 65.5\%-92.9\%)
(Figure \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} and Table
\ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_mod1}). Approximate confidence intervals based
on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the
estimated spawning biomass is high, although even the lower range of the
95\% interval for \%unfished is above the 40\% reference point, and all
sensitivity analyses explored also show the stock to be at a relatively
high level.

Recruitment was assumed to follow the Beverton-Holt stock recruit curve
with the steepness parameter fixed at \(h=0.4\), so uncertainty in
estimated recruitment is due to uncertainty in the estimated unfished

mortality (Figure \ref{fig:Recruits_all} and Table

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Exploitation Status}

Harvest rates estimated by the base model indicate catch levels have
been below the limits that would be associated with the Spawning
Potential Ratio (SPR) = 50\% limit (corresponding to a relative fishing
intensity of 100\%) (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_mod1} and Figures
\ref{fig:SPR_all} and \ref{fig:phase}). SPR is calculated as the

This stock assessment estimates that Big Skate in the model is above the
biomass target (\(B_{40\%}\)), and well above the minimum stock size
threshold (\(B_{25\%}\)). The estimated \%unfished level for the base
model in 2019 is 79.2\% (95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\)
65.5\%-92.9\%, corresponding to an unfished spawning biomass of 1999 mt
(95\% asymptotic interval: 566-3433 mt) of spawning biomass in the base
model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}). Unfished age 2+ biomass was
estimated to be 2,936 mt in the base case model. The target spawning
biomass (\(B_{40\%}\)) is 1,010 mt, which corresponds with an
equilibrium yield of 701 mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy \(F_{MSY}\)
harvest rate corresponding to \(SPR=50\%\) is 590 mt (Figure
\ref{fig:Yield_all}).

Big Skate have broad thermal tolerances and are broadly distributed,
occurring from the southeastern Bering Sea to southern Baja California
and the Gulf of California. They have been reported at depths of 2-501 m
but are most common on the inner continental shelf (\textless{} 100 m).
Big Skates are opportunistic predators with highly variable
spatio-temporal trophic roles.

In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations
were explicitly included in the analysis. This is primarily due to a
lack of relevant data or results of analyses that could contribute
ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.

Annual Catch Limits have only been in place for Big Skate in recent
years and total catch, including discards has remained below these
limits with the exception of 2014, where in retrospect the catch was
above the ACL although still below the Overfishing Limit (Table
\ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}).

Uncertainties}

The data provide little information about the scale of the population,
necessitating the use of a prior on catchability to maintain stable
model results. The prior was developed for the 2007 Longnose Skate stock
assessment and has not been revised to account for any differences
between the two species.

There is little evidence that the population is overfished or
experiencing overfishing, but forecasts of overfishing limits vary
considerably among the sensitivity analyses explored (though all remain
well above the recent average catch).

The fit to the length data was significantly improved by estimating a
difference between female and male selectivity, with females having a
lower maximum selectivity than males, but the behavioral processes that
might contribute to this difference are not understood.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Research and Data Needs}

We recommend the following research be conducted before the next
assessment.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Extend all ongoing data streams used in this assessment.} A longer fishery-independent index from a continued WCGBT Survey with associated compositions of length and age-at-length will improve understanding of dynamics of the stock. Continued sampling of lengths and ages from the landed catch and lengths, mean body weights, and discard rates from the fishery will be even more valuable for the years ahead now that Big Skate are landed as a separate market category and the estimates will be more precise.

\item \textbf{Investigate factors contributing to estimated lower selectivity for females than males.} Sex-specific differences in selectivity were included in the base model to better fit differences in sex ratios in the length composition data but the behavioral processes that might contribute to this pattern are not understood and other explanations for the sex ratios are possible.

\item \textbf{Investigate the distribution of Big Skate shallower than the 55 m limit of the WCGBT Survey.} This would help with interpretation of the biomass estimates from the survey and potentially refining the associated prior on catchability.

\item \textbf{Pursue additional approaches for estimating historical discards.} The approaches used here were based on averages applied over a period of decades. The catch reconstructions conducted for each state were much more sophisticated, but were applied only to the subset of the catch that was landed. Reconstructed spatial patterns of fishing effort could be used to estimate changes in total mortality over time.

\item \textbf{Improve understanding of links between Big Skate on the U.S. West Coast and other areas.} Tagging studies in Alaska indicated that Big Skate are capable of long distance movements. A better understanding of links through tagging in other areas and genetic studies could highlight strengths or weaknesses of the status-quo approach.

\item \textbf{Conduct studies of mortality of discarded skates in commercial fisheries.} Estimates of discard mortality for skates in general could be improved.

\item \textbf{Improve understanding of catch history and population dynamics of California Skate.} California Skate is the third most commonly occurring Skate in California waters after Longnose Skate and Big Skate and the catch reconstruction indicated that the center of abundance for California Skate is centered around San Francisco, where the fishery was strongest in the early years. If California Skate is found to be at a low biomass compared to historical levels it would have implications for the catch reconstruction of the other two species, as well as suggesting that management of California Skate should be a higher priority.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Skates are the largest and most widely distributed group of batoid fish
with approximately 245 species ascribed to two families (Ebert et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2007}{2007}), McEachran et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-McEachran1990}{1990})). Skates are benthic fish
that are found in all coastal waters but are most common in cold
temperatures and polar waters (Ebert et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2007}{2007}).

There are eleven species of skates in three genera (Amblyraja,
Bathyraja, and Raja) present in the Northeast Pacific Ocean off
California, Oregon and Washington (Ebert 2003). Of that number, just
three species (Longnose Skate, \emph{Beringraja rhina}; Big Skate,
\emph{Beringraja binoculata}; and Sandpaper Skate, \emph{Bathyraja
interrupta}) make up over 95 percent of West Coast Groundfish Bottom
Trawl Survey (WCGBTS) catches in terms of biomass and numbers, with the
Longnose Skate leading in both categories (with 62 percent of biomass
and 56 percent of numbers).

Big Skate (\emph{Beringraja binoculata}) is the largest of the skate
species in North America with a documented maximum length of 244 cm
total length and a maximum weight of 91 kg (Eschmeyer et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eschmeyer1983}{1983}). The species name
``binoculata'' (two-eyed) refers to the prominent ocellus at the base of
each pectoral fin. Big Skates are usually seen buried in sediment with
only their eyes showing.

\hypertarget{biology}{%
\subsection{Biology}\label{biology}}

Big Skate is oviparious, and is one of two skate species that have
multiple embryos per egg case (Ebert et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2008}{2008}). From 1--8 embryos can be
contained in a single, large egg capsule, but most have 3--4 (DeLacy et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-DeLacy1935}{1935}, Hitz
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hitz1964}{1964}, Ford
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ford1971}{1971}). Eggs are deposited year-round
on sand or mud substrates at depths of \textasciitilde{}50--150 m (Hitz
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hitz1964}{1964}, Ebert et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2007}{2007}). Embryos hatch from eggs after
6--20 months, with shorter developmental periods associated with warmer
temperatures (Hoff, GR \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hoff2009}{2009}). In
captivity, Big Skate females may produce \textgreater{} 350 eggs/year
(average of 2 embryos/egg case; Chiquillo et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chiquillo2014}{2014})) from long-term sperm
storage . Size at birth is 18--23 cm TL (Ebert
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2003}{2003}). Maximum size is 244 cm TL
(Eschmeyer et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Eschmeyer1983}{1983}), with
females growing to larger sizes.

Size at maturity has been variably estimated for Big Skate populations
off California, British Columbia, and Alaska. Off central California,
Zeiner and Wolf (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ZeinerWolf1993}{1993}) reported
sizes at first maturity of \textasciitilde{}129 cm TL (females) and
\textasciitilde{}100 cm TL (males). A similar size at maturity was
estimated for females from the Gulf of Alaska (first = 126 cm TL, 50\% =
149 cm TL), but male estimates were considerably greater (first = 124 cm
TL, 50\% = 119 cm TL; Ebert et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2008}{2008})). Much smaller sizes at first
(female = 60 cm TL, male = 50 cm TL) and 50\% (female = 90 cm TL, male =
72 cm TL) maturity were generated for the Longnose Skate populations off
British Columbia (GA et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McFandKing2006}{2006}); however, maturity
evaluation criteria were flawed (subadults were considered to be
mature), and these results are therefore not considered valid.

Age and growth parameters have been established from California, British
Columbia, and the Gulf of Alaska. Maximum ages off central California
(females = 12, males = 11; Zeiner, S.J. and P. Wolf.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ZeinerWolf1993}{1993})) and in the Gulf of
Alaska (females = 14, males = 15; Gburski et al.~2007) were similar, but
estimates off British Columbia were much greater (females = 26, males =
25; McFarlane and King 2006). It is important to note that age estimates
are based on an unvalidated method and geographic differences in size or
age may reflect differences in sampling or ageing criteria. In the Gulf
of Alaska, Big Skates reach 50\% maturity at 10 years and 7 years for
females and males, respectively (Gburski et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gburski2007}{2007}), Ebert et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2008}{2008})). Generation length estimates
range from 11.5 (Zeiner, S.J. and P. Wolf.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ZeinerWolf1993}{1993}) to 17 years (GA et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-McFandKing2006}{2006}).

\subsection{Distribution and Life
History}\label{distribution-and-life-history}}

The Big Skate is most common in soft-sediment habitats in coastal waters
of the continental shelf (Bizzarro et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2014}{2014}), Farrugia et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})). Use of mixed substrate
(e.g., mud with boulders) increases with ontogeny but hard substrates
are largely avoided (Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). In the GOA, the Big Skate
is the most commonly encountered skate species in continental shelf
waters at 100--200 m depth, and is most abundant in the central and
western areas of the GOA (Stevenson et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Stevenson2008}{2008}); Bizzarro et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2014}{2014})). Off the U.S. Pacific
Coast, the Big Skate is most densely distributed on the inner
continental shelf (\textless{} 100 m; Bizzarro et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2014}{2014})). Eggs are mainly deposited
between 70--90 m on sand or mud substrates (Hitz
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hitz1964}{1964}); NMFS-NWFSC-FRAM, unpub. data).
Juveniles typically occur in shallower waters than adults (Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). Core habitat regions of
Big Skate off the U.S. Pacific Coast and in the Gulf of Alaska are
spatially segregated from those of other species (Bizzarro et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2014}{2014})).

Big Skates are highly mobile and capable of long range (\textgreater{}
2000 km) movements (King, JR and McFarlane, GA
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-KingandMcF2010}{2010}); Farrugia et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})). For example, in British
Columbia, a study revealed that \textasciitilde{}75\% of tagged
individuals were recaptured within 21 km of the tagging locations, but
15 of the tagged individuals (0.1\%) moved over 1,000 km (max = 2340 km;
King, JR and McFarlane, GA
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-KingandMcF2010}{2010})). In the Gulf of Alaska,
a year of satellite tag data showed that six of twelve tagged
individuals moved over 100 km, with one skate moving \textgreater{}
2,000 km (Farrugia et al.~2016). Although primarily benthic, Big Skates
utilize the entire water column including surface waters (Farrugia et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})). They have broad
thermal tolerances 2--19Âº C that enable their occurrence from boreal to
subtropical latitudes (Love, Milton S
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}); Farrugia et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})).

The Big Skate is broadly distributed, occurring from the southeastern
Bering Sea (Mecklenburg et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mecklenburg2002}{2002}) to southern Baja
California (22.90Âº N, 110.03Âº W; (Castro-Aguirre et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Castro1993}{1993})) and the Gulf of California
(Castro-Aguirre et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Castro1996}{1996}). It has
been reported at depths of 2--501 m (min: Miller et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller1980}{1980}); max: Farrugia et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})) but is most common on the
inner continental shelf (\textless{} 100 m; (Love, Milton S
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011}); (Bizzarro
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). Big Skates are highly
mobile and capable of long range (\textgreater{} 2000 km) movements
((King et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-KingandMcF2009}{2009}); (Farrugia
et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Farrugia2016}{2016})).

In 2012, the Big Skate was moved from genus \emph{Raja} to the new genus
\emph{Beringraja} together with the Mottled Skate (\emph{B. pulchra})
(Ishihara et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ishihara2012}{2012}). These are
the only two skates with multiple embryos per egg case, and they are
very similar mophologically and genetically (Bizzarro, J.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2019}{2019}). More recently, Longnose
Skate has also moved to \emph{Beringraja} (Last et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Last2016}{2016}).

\hypertarget{ecosystem-considerations-1}{%
\subsection{Ecosystem Considerations}\label{ecosystem-considerations-1}}

Big Skates are opportunistic, generalist mesopredators with highly
variable spatio-temporal trophic roles (Ebert et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2007}{2007}); Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). Off central California,
diet of Big Skates is composed mainly of fishes, shrimps, and crabs (in
descending order), with larger skates incorporating more fishes
(Bizzarro et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2007}{2007})); however,
in the Gulf of Alaska, Big Skate diet consists mainly of crabs
(esp.~Tanner Crabs) throughout ontogeny, with relatively small portions
of fishes and shrimps (Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})). Correspondingly, trophic
level and general diet composition estimates differ significantly
between California and Gulf of Alaska Big Skate populations (Bizzarro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2015}{2015})).

Big Skates and their egg cases are preyed upon by a variety of
vertebrates and invertebrates. Snails and other molluscs bore holes in
egg cases to feed on developing embryos and especially their protein
rich yolk-sacs (Bizzarro, pers. obs; Hoff, GR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hoff2009}{2009})). Sevengill Sharks, Brown
Rockfish, and Stellar Sea Lions are known predators of juvenile and
adult Big Skates (Ebert (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2003}{2003}), Love,
Milton S (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011})). Northern Sea Lions
consume free-living Big Skates and their egg cases (Ebert
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2003}{2003}), Love, Milton S
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2011}{2011})).

In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations
were explicitly included in the analysis. This is primarily due to a
lack of relevant data or results of analyses that could contribute
ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.

\hypertarget{fishery-information}{%
\subsection{Fishery Information}\label{fishery-information}}

Big Skate are caught in commercial and recreational fisheries on the
West Coast using line and trawl gears. There is a limited market for
pectoral fins (skate wings).

The history of Big Skate is not well documented. They were used as a
food source by the native Coastal and Salish Tribes (Batdorf, C
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Batdorf1990}{1990}) long before Europeans settled
in the Pacific Northwest and then as fertilizer by the settlers (Bowers,
G. M. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bowers1909}{1909}). No directed fishery for
Big Skate has been documented; rather, they were taken along with other
skates and rays as ``scrap fish'' and used for fertilizer, fish meal and
oil (Lippert \protect\hyperlink{ref-GregLippert}{2019}).

Skates have been regarded as a predator on desirable market species such
as Dungeness crab, and were thought of as nuisance fish with no appeal
as a food item save for small local markets. They had been discarded or
harvested at a minimal level until their livers became valued along with
those of other cartilaginous fishes for the extraction of vitamin A in
the 1940s. Chapman (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chapman1944}{1944}) recorded
that ``At present they are being fished heavily, in common with the
other elasmobranchs of the coast, for the vitamins in their livers. The
carcasses are either thrown away at sea or made into fish meal. Little
use is made of the excellent meat of the wings''.

Little information is available about the historic Washington fishery
for Big Skate. In records before 2000, they are lumped together with
other skates or in market categories (Lippert
\protect\hyperlink{ref-GregLippert}{2019}); this necessitates
considerable attention to reconstructing the fishery by observing the
composition of skate catches in the modern fishery and applying those to
the recently reconstructed historical records.

Very little information is known about the Big Skate historical fishery
in Oregon. The information we do have is mainly from historical landing
data and species composition samples starting in the mid-nineties. The
bulk of the catch is from the bottom trawl and longline fisheries, with
smaller amounts as by-catch in mid-water trawl and the shrimp trawl
fishery. Big Skate was lumped into the nominal ``Skate'' category until
2015 when it was separated into its own market category. Species
composition data have been vitally important in reconstructing the
pre-2015 historical catch (Calavan
\protect\hyperlink{ref-TedCalavan}{2019}).

\hypertarget{stock-status-and-management-history}{%
\subsection{Stock Status and Management
History}\label{stock-status-and-management-history}}

The history of Big Skate management is documented in (Pacific Fishery
Management Council \protect\hyperlink{ref-PFMC2018}{2018}), reproduced
here.

Big Skate were managed in the ``Other Fish'' complex until 2015 when
they were designated an Ecosystem Component (EC) species. Catches of Big
Skate are estimated to have averaged 95 mt from 2007--2011, along with
large landings of ``Unspecified Skate''. Analysis of Oregon
port-sampling data indicates that about 98 percent of the recent
Unspecified Skate landings in Oregon were comprised of Big Skate. Such
large landings indicates targeting of Big Skate has occurred and an EC
designation was not warranted. Based on this evidence, Big Skate was
redesignated as an actively-managed species in the fishery. Big Skate
has been managed with stock-specific harvest specifications since 2017
(Pacific Fishery Management Council
\protect\hyperlink{ref-PFMC2018}{2018}).

The recent OFL of 541 mt was calculated by applying approximate MSY
harvest rates to estimates of stock biomass from the Northwest Fisheries
Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey. This
survey-based biomass estimate is likely underestimated since Big Skate
are distributed all the way to the shoreline and no West Coast trawl
surveys have been conducted in water shallower than 55 meters. This
introduces an extra source of uncertainty to management and suggests
that increased precaution is needed to reduce the risk of overfishing
the stock (Pacific Fishery Management Council
\protect\hyperlink{ref-PFMC2018}{2018}).

There has been consideration for managing Big Skate in a complex with
Longnose Skate, the other actively-managed West Coast skate species, but
the two species have disparate distributions and fishery interactions
(Longnose Skate is much more deeply distributed than Big Skate) and that
option was not endorsed. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has
chosen to set the Annual Catch Limit (ACL) equal to the Allowable
Biological Catch (ABC) with a buffer for management uncertainty (P*) of
0.45 (Pacific Fishery Management Council
\protect\hyperlink{ref-PFMC2018}{2018}).

\hypertarget{fisheries-off-alaska-canada-and-mexico}{%
\subsection{Fisheries Off Alaska, Canada and
Mexico}\label{fisheries-off-alaska-canada-and-mexico}}

\hypertarget{alaska}{%
\subsubsection{Alaska}\label{alaska}}

In Alaska, skates were primarily taken as bycatch in both longline and
trawl fisheries until 2003, when a directed skate fishery developed in
the Gulf of Alaska, where Longnose and Big Skate comprise the majority
of the skate biomass.

The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) skate complex is managed as three units. Big
skates and Longnose Skates each have separate harvest specifications,
with acceptable biological catches (ABCs) specified for each GOA
regulatory area (western, central, and eastern). A single gulfwide
overfishing level (OFL) is specified for each stock. All remaining skate
species are managed as an ``Other Skates'' group with gulfwide harvest
specifications. All GOA skates are managed as Tier 5 stocks, where OFL
and ABC are based on survey biomass estimates and natural mortality rate
(Alaska Fisheries Science Center
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AFSC2018}{2018}).

In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, skates are assessed as a group
rather than as separate species.

\hypertarget{canada}{%
\subsubsection{Canada}\label{canada}}

In Canada historic information regarding skate catches goes back to the
1950's. Prior to 1990's skates were taken mostly as bycatch and landings
were reported as part of a skate complex (not by species). As with the
U.S. West Coast, the trawl fishery is responsible for the largest amount
of bycatch. Skate catches off British Columbia accelerated in the early
1990's, partly due to emerging Asian markets. Since 1996, Longnose Skate
has been targeted by the B.C. trawl fishery and as a result, catches
have been more accurately reported.

Assessments of Longnose Skate and Big Skate were conducted by Canada's
Division of Fisheries and Oceans in 2015 (King et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-King2015}{2015}). For Big Skate, a Bayesian
surplus production model failed to provide plausible results, and two
data-limited approaches were investigated: Depletion-Corrected Average
Catch Analysis (DCAC), and a Catch-MSY (maximum sustainable yield)
Approach.

DCAC produced a range of potential yield estimates that were above the
long-term average catch, with an upper bound that was three orders of
magnitude larger than the long-term average catch. The Catch-MSY
approach was found to be quite sensitive to assumptions and was not
recommended as the sole basis of advice to managers.

The recommendation for management for both skate species was that they
should be managed with harvest yields based on mean historic catch, with
consideration given to survey trends and to the ranges of maximum
sustainable yield estimates identified by the Catch-MSY Approach.
However, the analysis found no significant trends in abundance indices
for Big Skate, and mean historical catches were below the maximum MSY
estimate from the catch-MSY results.

\hypertarget{mexico}{%

No information is available on any fishery for Big Skate in Mexican
waters, where they rarely occur, however they may be taken in the
artisanal fishery.

Data used in the Big Skate assessment are summarized in Figure

following sections.

\hypertarget{fishery-landings-and-discards}{%
\subsection{Fishery Landings and
Discards}\label{fishery-landings-and-discards}}

Catch information for Big Skate is very limited, in part because the
requirement to sort landings of Big Skate in the shore-based Individual
Fishing Quota fishery from landings in the ``Unidentified Skate''
category was not implemented until June 2015. The historical catch of
Big Skate therefore relies on the historical reconstruction of the
landings of all skates as well as an analysis of discards of Longnose
Skate. The estimated landings for each state and the tribal fishery are
provided in Table \ref{tab:Reconstructed_Landings_byState} and shown in
Figure \ref{fig:catch_by_state}.

\hypertarget{washington-commercial-skate-landings-reconstruction}{%
\subsubsection{Washington Commercial Skate Landings
Reconstruction}\label{washington-commercial-skate-landings-reconstruction}}

New estimates of landings in Washington were developed in collaboration
between NWFSC and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW).
Landings from 1940--2003 were estimated as a fraction of the total skate
landings based on ratios of species compositions by depth as described
in more detail in (Gertseva, V.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2019}{2019}). The approach relied on
trawl survey estimates of the ratios among all skates by depth bin
combined with logbook estimates of fishing depths in each year.

The WCGBT Survey data was used to estimate proportions of Longnose and
Big Skates by depth (aggregated into 100m bins) and year for the period
of the survey (between 2003 and 2018). Big Skate were primarily found in
the 0--100m and 100--200m bins. Trawl logbook data include information
on the amount of retained catch of skate (all species combined) within
each haul as well depth of catch. The proportion of Big Skate for each
depth bin was assigned to the skate catch for each haul within those
depth bins and summed to get a total for each year. When survey skate
information was available (2003-2018), survey skate proportions were
applied by depth and year to account for inter-annual variability in
those proportions. For the period prior to 2003, average proportions
from 2003-2007 within each depth bin were applied.

These estimated annual proportions of Big Skate relative to all skates
from the logbook analysis was then applied to total Washington skate
landings by year (provided by WDFW) to account for landings that weren't
included in the available logbook data. For the period prior to 1987
(when no logbook data were available), the average proportion of Big
Skate within the combined skate category, calculated from 1987-1992
logbook data, was applied to total skate landings in Washington.
Estimated Big Skate landings provided by WDFW were used for the period
from 2004 forward. This later period had adequate species composition
sampling to divide the unspecified skate category by species with
reasonable accuracy.

\hypertarget{oregon-commercial-skate-landings-reconstruction}{%
\subsubsection{Oregon Commercial Skate Landings
Reconstruction}\label{oregon-commercial-skate-landings-reconstruction}}

Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) provided newly
reconstructed commercial landings for all observed skate species for the
2019 assessment cycle (1978 -- 2018). In addition, the methods were
reviewed at a pre-assessment workshop. Historically, skates were landed
as a single skate complex in Oregon. In 2009, Longnose Skate was
separated into its own single-species landing category, and Big Skate
was separated in 2014. The reconstruction methodology differed by these
three time blocks in which species composition collections diverged
(1978 -- 2008; 2009 -- 2014; 2015 -- 2018).

Species compositions of skate complexes from commercial port sampling
are available throughout this time period but are generally limited,
which precluded the use of all strata for reconstructing landings.
Quarter and port were excluded, retaining gear type, PMFC area, and
market category for stratifying reconstructed landings within the three
time blocks. Bottom trawl gear types include multiple bottom trawl
gears, and account for greater than 98\% of skate landings . Minor gear
types include primarily bottom longline gear, but also include mid-water
trawl, hook and line, shrimp trawl, pot gear and scallop dredge.

For bottom trawl gears, trawl logbook areas and adjusted skate catches
were matched with stratum-specific species compositions. In Time Block 1
(1978 -- 2008), all bottom trawl gear types were aggregated due to a
lack of specificity in the gear recorded on the fish tickets. However,
in Time Blocks 2 and 3, individual bottom trawl gear types were
retained. Some borrowing of species compositions was required (31\% of
strata) and when necessary, borrowed from the closest area or from the
most similar gear type . Longline gear landings were reconstructed in a
similar fashion as to bottom trawl and required some borrowing among
strata as well (25\%).

Due to insufficient species compositions, mid-water trawl landings were
reconstructed using a novel depth-based approach. Available compositions
indicate that the proportion by weight of Big Skate within a composition
drops to zero at approximately 100 fathoms, and an inverse relationship
is observed for Longnose Skate, where the proportion by weight is
consistently one beyond 100 -- 150 fathoms . Complex-level landings were
assigned a depth from logbook entries and these species specific depth
associations were used to parse out landings by species. The approach
differed somewhat by time block . Landings from shrimp trawls were
handled using a similar methodology. Finally, very minor landings from
hook and line, pot gear and scallop dredges were assigned a single
aggregated species composition, as they lack any gear-specific
composition samples. Landings from within a time block were apportioned
by year using the proportion of the annual ticket landings.

Results indicate that the species-specific landings from this
reconstruction are very similar to those from Oregon's commercial catch
reconstruction (Karnowski et al.~2014) during the overlapping years but
cover a greater time period with methodology more applicable to skates
in particular. ODFW intends to incorporate reconstructed skate landings
into PacFIN in the future (Whitman
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Whitman2019}{2019}).

\hypertarget{california-catch-reconstruction}{%
\subsubsection{California Catch
Reconstruction}\label{california-catch-reconstruction}}

A reconstruction of historical skate landings from California waters was
developed for the 1916--2017 time period using a combination of
commercial catch data (spatially explicit block summary catches and port
sample data from 2009-2017) and fishery-independent survey data
(Bizzarro, J. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bizzarro2019}{2019}). Virtually all
landings in California were of ``unspecified skate'' until
species-composition sampling of skate market categories began in 2009.

From 2009 through 2017, catch estimates were based on these market
category species-composition samples, and the average of those
species-compositions was hindcast to 2002, based on the assumption that
those data were representative of the era of large area closures in the
post-2000 period.

For the period from 1936-1980, spatially explicit landings data (the
California Department of Fisheries and Wildlife (CDFW) block summary
data) were merged with survey data to provide species-specific
estimates.

For years 1981-2001, a ``blended'' product of these two approaches was
taken, in which a linear weighting scheme blended the two sets of catch
estimates through that period. Landings estimates were also scaled
upwards by an expansion factor for skates landed as ``dressed'' based on
fish ticket data. Prior to 1981 these data had not been reported and
skate landings were scaled by the ``average'' percentage landed as
dressed in the 1981-1985 time period, but by the late 1980s nearly all
skates were landed round.

As no spatial information on catch is available from 1916-1930, and the
block summary data were very sparse in the first few years of the CDFW
fish ticket program (1931--1934), spatial information from the late
1930's was used to hindcast to the 1916--1935 time period. However,
since Washington and Oregon did not have catch estimates for this year
period, the California estimates of catch prior to 1939 were not used in
the model as they were subsumed into an estimate of the total catch
across all states increasing linearly from 1916 to 1950.

\hypertarget{tribal-catch-in-washington}{%
\subsubsection{Tribal Catch in
Washington}\label{tribal-catch-in-washington}}

Tribal catch of Big Skate was provided by WDFW as all landings took
place in Washington State. The landings were estimated from limited
state sampling of species compositions in combined skate category.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that most of the catch in tribal fishery is
retained, and discard is minimal.

\hypertarget{fishery-discards}{%
\subsubsection{Fishery Discards}\label{fishery-discards}}

Fishery discards of Big Skate are highly uncertain. The method used to
estimate discards for Longnose Skate was based on a strong correlation
(R\textsuperscript{2} = 95.7\%) between total mortality of that species,
and total mortality of Dover Sole for the years 2009--2017 during which
Longnose were landed separately from other skates. In contrast, the
sorting requirement for Big Skate occurred too recently to provide an
adequate range of years for this type of correlation. Furthermore, there
is greater uncertainty in the total mortality for the shallow-water
species with which Big Skate most often co-occurs, such as Sand Sole and
Starry Flounder, than there is for Dover Sole, which has been the
subject of recurring stock assessments.

The minimal discard rate information that is available for Big Skate,
together with anecdotal information from those involved in the fishery
for both skate species indicate that discarding for Big Skate and
Longnose Skate in the years prior to 1995 was driven by the same market
forces, and the discard rates were similar. Therefore, the discard rate
for Longnose Skate was used as a proxy for the discards of Big Skate in
order to estimate Big Skate discards.

The reconstructed landings of Big Skate for the period 1950--1995 had a
mean of 63.1 t with no significant trend (a linear model fit to the data
increased from 62.8 t in 1950 to 63.5 in 1995). The estimated tribal
catch prior to 1995 averaged less than 1 t and was not included in this
analysis of Big Skate discards for the years prior to 1995.

The mean discard rate for Longnose Skate in this period was 92.46\%,
also with no significant linear trend (the linear fit decreased from
92.8\% in 1950 to 92.1\% in 1995). An estimate of the mean annual
discard amount can therefore be calculated as from the mean discard rate
and the mean landings as \(\bar{L} / (1 - \bar{d})\) where \(\bar{L}\)
is the mean landings across that time period and \(\bar{d}\) is the mean
discards (Figure \ref{fig:discard_calculations}).

Two alternative methods were used to estimate the mean annual discard
amount: applying the annual Longnose Skate discard rates to the annual
Big Skate catch, and applying 3-year moving averages of these two
quantities. The use of the annual values resulted in an implausibly high
degree of annual variability among the estimates, with the most extreme
being a spike of 2146.4 in 1979 compared to 1032.7 t the year before and
654.0 the year after. The use of the 3-year moving average damped this
variability and these estimates were retained for a sensitivity analysis
(Figure \ref{fig:discard_calculations}).

A discard mortality rate of 50 percent was assumed for all discards,
following the assumption used for the Longnose Skate assessment
conducted for the U.S. West Coast in 2007 (Gertseva, V and Schirippa, MJ
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2007}{2007}) The same rate has been used
for skates in the trawl fishery in British Columbia, based on an
approximate average of these reported rates. In 2015, PFMC's Groundfish
Management Team (GMT) conducted a comprehensive literature review of
skate discard mortality, and concluded that the current assumption
regarding Big Skate discard mortality is consistent with existing
reported rates for other similar species.

Estimation of discard rates (discard amount relative to total catch)
during the period of the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP),
which began in 2002, was hindered by the landings of Big Skate primarily
occurring in the ``unspecified skate'' category prior to 2015.
Therefore, a discard rate was computed for this period using the
combination of Big Skate and unspecified skate, under the assumption
that the vast majority of the unspecified skates were Big Skate. A
coefficient of variation was calculated for this rate by bootstrapping
vessels within ports, because the observer program randomly chooses
vessels within ports to be observed. For the years after the catch share
program was implemented in 2011, the trawl fishery was subject to 100\%
observer coverage and discarding is assumed to be known with minimal
error (CV = 0.01).

The mean body weight of discarded Big Skates, calculated from the weight
and count of baskets of discarded Big Skate, was available for the years
2002--2017.

\subsubsection{Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) Triennial Shelf
Survey}\label{alaska-fisheries-science-center-afsc-triennial-shelf-survey}}

Research surveys have been used since the 1970s to provide
fishery-independent information about the abundance, distribution, and
biological characteristics of Big Skate. A coast-wide survey was
conducted in 1977 (Gunderson, DR and Sample, TM
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gunderson1980}{1980}) by the Alaska Fisheries
Science Center, and repeated every three years through 2001. The final
year of this survey, 2004, was conducted by the NWFSC according to the
AFSC protocol. We refer to this as the \textbf{Triennial Survey}.

The survey design used equally-spaced transects from which searches for
tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The depth range and
latitudinal range was not consistent across years, but all years in the
period 1980-2004 included the area from 40\(^\circ\) 10'N north to the
Canadian border and a depth range that included 55-366 meters, which
spans the range where the vast majority of Big Skate are encountered in
all trawl surveys. Therefore the index was based on this depth range.
The survey as conducted in 1977 had incomplete coverage and is not
believe to be comparable to the later years, and is not used in the
index.

\subsubsection{Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish
Bottom Trawl
Survey}\label{northwest-fisheries-science-center-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}}

In 2003, the NWFSC took over an ongoing slope survey that the AFSC had
been conducting, and expanded it spatially to include the continental
shelf. This survey, referred to in this document as the ``WCGBT Survey''
or ``WCGBTS'', is conducted annually. It uses a random-grid design
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m from
late-May to early-October (Bradburn, M.J. and Keller, A.A and Horness,
B.H. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bradburn2011}{2011} , Keller, A.A. and
Wallace, J.R. and Methot, R.D.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Keller2017}{2017}). Four chartered industry
vessels are used in most years. The location of Big Skate catches
relative to all survey stations in WCGBT Survey are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:survey_hauls_map}.

\hypertarget{index-standardization}{%
\subsubsection{Index Standardization}\label{index-standardization}}

The index standardization methods for the two bottom trawl surveys
matched that used for Longnose Skate, and additional detail is provided
in (Gertseva, V. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2019}{2019}). The data
from both surveys was analyzed using a spatio-temporal delta-model
(Thorson, J. T. and Shelton, A. O. and Ward, E. J. and Skaug, H. J.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorson2015}{2015}), implemented as the VAST R
package (Thorson, James T. and Barnett, Lewis A. K.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorson2017a}{2017}), and publicly available
online (\url{https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST}). Spatial and
spatio-temporal variation is specifically included in both encounter
probability and positive catch rates, using a logit-link for encounter
probability, and a log-link for positive catch rates. Vessel-year
effects were included for each unique combination of vessel and year in
the database for the WCGBT Survey, but not for the Triennial survey.
Further details regarding model structure are available in the user
manual
(\url{https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/blob/master/manual/VAST_model_structure.pdf}).
Gamma and lognormal error structures were considered for the positive
catch rates, and the gamma model was chosen based on the patterns in the
quantile-quantile (Q-Q) diagnostic plots (Figure
\ref{fig:VAST_QQ_plots}).

The VAST geostatistical estimates were compared to a simpler
design-based index estimate to ground-truth the geostatistical methods.
The design-based estimates were based on the mean catch per swept area
within each of four strata, scaled to the area of the strata and
combined. The strata were divided at 42 degrees North latitude and at
183 m depth, where the depth boundary is associated with a change in the
sampling density of the survey. The two deeper strata were extended to
549 m, the next depth at which sampling density changes in the survey,
and beyond the 459 m at which the deepest observation of Big Skate
occurred.

The VAST estimates with Gamma error are very similar to the
designed-based estimates, while the VAST models with Lognormal error are
higher, with greater inter-annual variability (Figure
\ref{fig:Triennial_index_compare} and fig:WCGBTS\_index\_compare). The
unweighted mean biomass across all years in the WCGBT Survey was 12,143
mt for the design-based estimate and 12,184 mt for the VAST estimate
with Gamma error. This difference of less than 1\% suggests that
interpretation of catchability of the index is not significantly
influenced by the use of VAST for standardization, at least for the
Gamma error that was chosen.

Spatial patterns in the standardized survey density estimates show Big
Skate widely distributed along the coast, with higher densities in the
central and more northerly areas and closer to shore (Figure
\ref{fig:VAST_Yearly_Dens_Triennial}).

\hypertarget{international-pacific-halibut-commission-longline-survey}{%
\subsubsection{International Pacific Halibut Commission Longline
Survey}\label{international-pacific-halibut-commission-longline-survey}}

The IPHC has conducted an annual longline survey for Pacific Halibut off
the coast of Oregon and Washington since 1997 (no surveys were performed
in 1998 or 2000). This survey was considered for inclusion in the
assessment model but the encounters of Big Skate are relatively
infrequent compared to Longnose Skate and including the survey in early
model explorations was found to make little difference in the model
results. A description of the survey methods and analysis are included
below for consideration in future Big Skate assessments.

Beginning in 1999, this has been a fixed station design, with 84
locations (station locations differed in 1997, and are therefore not
comparable with subsequent surveys). 400 to 800 hooks have been deployed
at each station in 100-hook groups (typically called ``skates'' although
that term will be avoided here to avoid confusion). The gear used to
conduct the survey was designed to efficiently sample Pacific Halibut
and used 16/0 (\#3) circle hooks baited with Chum Salmon.

In some years from 2011 onward, additional stations were added to the
survey to sample Yelloweye Rockfish. These stations were excluded from
the analysis, as were additional stations added in 2013, 2014, and 2017,
off the coast of California (south of 42 degrees latitude). Some
variability in exact sampling location is practically unavoidable, and
leeway is given in the IPHC methods to center the set on the target
coordinates, while allowing wind and currents to dictate the actual
direction in which the gear is deployed. This can result in different
habitats being accessed at each fixed deployment location across years.
One station that was very close to the U.S. Canada border had the
mid-point of the set in Canada in 2 out of the 19 years of the survey.
For consistency among years, all samples from this station were included
in the analysis, including those in Canada.

In most years, bycatch of non-halibut species has been recorded during
this survey on the first 20 hooks of each 100-hook group, although in
2003 only 10\% of the hooks were observed for bycatch, and starting in
2012, some stations had 100\% of the hooks observed for bycatch.
Combining these observation pattern with the number of hooks deployed
each year resulted in most stations having 80, 100, 120, 140, or 160
hooks observed, with a mean of 144 hooks and a maximum of 800 hooks
observed. The depth range of the 84 stations considered was 42---530 m,
thus extending beyond the range of Big Skate, but 74\% of the stations
were shallower than 200 m. Big Skate have been observed at 51 of the 84
standard stations that were retained for this analysis, but no station
had Big Skates observed in more than 12 out of the 19 years of survey
data, and only 10\% of the station/year combinations had at least one
observed Big Skate (Figure \ref{fig:IPHC_map}). Of those station/year
combinations with at least one Big Skate observed, the Big Skates were
observed on an average of 1.3\% of the hooks observed. The highest
proportion was 10 Big Skates out of 81 hooks observed at one station.

The IPHC longline survey catch data were standardized using a
Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with binomial error structure.
Catch-per-hook was modeled, rather than catch per station due to the
variability in the number of hooks deployed and observed each year. The
binomial error structure was considered logical, given the binary nature
of capturing (or not) a Longnose Skate on each longline hook. The
modeling approach is identical to that which has been applied in the
past for Yelloweye Rockfish (Stewart et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Stewart2009}{2009}), and Spiny Dogfish (Gertseva
et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2011}{2011}). MCMC sampling of the
GLM parameters was used to estimate the variability around each index
estimate. The median index estimates themselves were approximately equal
to the observed mean catch rate in each year (Figure
\ref{fig:IPHC_index}). In recent years, the IPHC standardization of the
index of halibut abundance has included an adjustment to account for
missing baits on hooks returned empty, in an effort to account for
reduced catchability of the gear that may result from the lost bait.
This adjustment was not included in the analysis for Big Skate although
it could be considered in future years. \newpage

\hypertarget{measurement-details-and-conversion-factors}{%
\subsection{Measurement Details and Conversion
Factors}\label{measurement-details-and-conversion-factors}}

Size measurements of skates are not always total-length measurements,
requiring conversion factors. Some size measurements in the data are
recorded as either disc width or inter-spiracle width. A conversion
factor from disc width to total-length was estimated as
\(L = 1.3399 * W\), based on 95 samples from the WCGBT Survey, where
both measurements were collected (R-squared = 0.9983). Little sex
difference is observed, so the data were converted using a single
relationship for both sexes (Figure \ref{fig:weight-length}). This
estimate is similar to the conversion estimated by Ebert
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ebert2008}{2008}) for Big Skate in Alaska. The
inter-spiracle width to total length conversion was based on estimates
from Downs \& Cheng (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Downs2013}{2013}), and does
differ by sex:

\begin{centering}

$L = 12.111 + 9.761*ISW$ (females),

$L = 3.824 + 10.927*ISW$ (males).

\end{centering}

\hypertarget{fishery-dependent-length-and-age-composition-data}{%
\subsection{Fishery dependent length and age composition
data}\label{fishery-dependent-length-and-age-composition-data}}

Fishery length composition data from PacFIN were available for the years
1995--2018 (with the exception of 2000) as shown in Table
\ref{tab:PacFIN_Samples}. Ages were available only from 2004, 2008-2012,
and 2018. These were all represented in the model as conditioned on
length, in order to provide more detailed information about the
relationship between age and length. Treating the data this way also
reduces any influence of size-based selectivity on the age composition,
and ensures independence from the length samples. Furthermore, samples
recorded in data from Washington in 2009 were sampled using a
length-stratified system, and therefore should only be treated as
conditioned on length.

Length compositions of Big Skate discarded in commercial fisheries and
measured by the West Coast Groundfish Observer program were available
for the years 2010--2017.

The input sample sizes for the length compositions were calculated via
the Stewart Method ({\textbf{???}}):

\begin{centering}

Input N = $N_{\text{hauls}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{hauls}}$ is $<$ 44,

Input N = $7.06 * N_{\text{hauls}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{hauls}}$ is $\geq$ 44.

\end{centering}

However, no haul had more than 44 Big Skate sampled, so only the first
formula was used.

\hypertarget{survey-length-and-age-composition-data}{%
\subsection{Survey length and age composition
data}\label{survey-length-and-age-composition-data}}

Lengths of Big Skate were only collected from the Triennial survey in
1998, 2001, and 2004, but in 1998 only 3 Big Skate were sampled, so
those lengths were excluded from this analysis. Length compositions were
available for all years of the WCGBT Survey. Sample sizes for both
surveys are provided in Table \ref{tab:Survey_Samples}. The WCGBT Survey
measured disc width for the years 2006 and 2007, and total length in all
other years. Those samples for which only disc width was measured were
converted to total length using the formula above.

The length compositions from the fishery and each of the two surveys
aggregated across all years is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time}.

Ages were available from the WCGBT Survey in the years 2009, 2010, 2016,
2017, and 2018. No ages were available from the Triennial Survey.

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Ageing Precision and Bias}

Ages of Big Skate were all estimated based on growth band counts of
sectioned vertebrae. Ageing precision and bias were estimated using
double-reads of 518 Big Skate vertebrae using the approach of Punt et
al.~(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Punt2008}{2008}). The results showed strong
agreement among readers (Figure \ref{fig:ageing_comparison}), with a
standard deviation of the ageing error increasing from about 0.4 at age
0 to 1.6 years at age 15 (Figure \ref{fig:ageing_imprecision}).

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Weight-Length}

The mean weight as a function of length was estimated from 1159 samples
from the WCGBT Survey using a linear regression on a log-log scale. Sex
was not found to be a significant predictor, so a single relationship
was estimated: \(Weight = 0.00000749 * Length ^ {2.9925}\) (Figure
\ref{fig:weight-length}).

\vspace{.5cm}

\textbf{Sex Ratio, Maturity, and Fecundity}

The female maturity relationship was based on visual maturity estimates
from port samplers (n = 278, of which 241 were from Oregon and 37 from
Washington, with 24 mature specimens) as well as 55 samples from the
WCGBT Survey (of which 4 were mature). The resulting relationship was
\(L_{50\%} = 148.245\) with a slope parameter of \(Beta = -0.13155\) in
the relationship \(M = (1 + Beta(L - L_{50\%}))^{-1}\) (Figure
\ref{fig:maturity}). This result is consistent with the estimated
maturity of Big Skate in Alaska (Table \ref{tab:Life_Hist}).

Fecundity was assumed to be proportional to body weight for mature
females, as no relationship has been estimated between body weight and
the annual number of egg cases produced (and/or embryos per egg case).

This analysis represents the first stock assessment that has been

an OFL estimate calculated from a proxy for \(F_{MSY}\) and average
survey biomass from the WCGBT Survey during the years 2010--2012 (Taylor
IG and Cope, J and Hamel O and Thorson, J
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Taylor2013}{2013}). The \(F_{MSY}\) estimate was
based on the product of an assumed \(F_{MSY}/M\) ratio and an \(M\)
estimate of 0.162 based on the maximum age of 26 reported by McFarlane
and King (GA et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-McFandKing2006}{2006}).
Values were sampled from an assumed distribution around all these
quantities to develop a measure of uncertainty around the OFL estimate.

\hypertarget{summary-of-data-for-fleets-and-areas}{%
\subsubsection{Summary of Data for Fleets and
Areas}\label{summary-of-data-for-fleets-and-areas}}

Catch is divided among 4 fleets in the base model:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fishery (current) combines all non-tribal sources of catch for the years 1995 onward,
\item Discard (historical) is the estimated discard amount calculated from the estimated Longnose Skate discard rate as described above. The input catch for this fleet was 50\% of the total estimate, to account for the assumed 50\% discard mortality rate. This data covers the period 1916--1994.
\item Fishery (historical) includes the reconstructed landings estimates from each of the three states for 1916--1994.
\item Tribal includes the estimates of catch of Big Skate by treaty tribes.
\end{itemize}

The use of a separate fleet for historical discards allowed greater
flexibility in choosing how to model discards outside the model, but
also prevented uncertainty in those estimates to be propagated through
to the estimated uncertainty in the model results. All four fleets were
assumed to have the same selectivity.

A retention function was estimated for the current fishery, and discards
were estimated within the model based on the fit to discard rates and
mean body weight of the discarded fish (along with all other data in the
integrated analysis). The choice to model retention explicitly only for
the current fishery implies that the historical landings and historical
discards represented the same subset of the population. During the
historical period, the landed catch is likely to have contained fewer
small fish than the discards, but the estimated discard rate is greater
than 90\%, so it necessarily includes fish of all sizes. During the
historical period, skates were used for animal food and reduction to
fish meal or fertilizer, markets which may have accepted skate of all
sizes.

\hypertarget{other-specifications}{%
\subsubsection{Other Specifications}\label{other-specifications}}

This assessment covers the U.S. West Coast stock of Big Skate in off the
coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, the area bounded by the
U.S.-Canada border to the north, and the U.S.-Mexico border to the
south. The population is treated as a single coastwide stock with no net
movement in or out of the area. Females and males are modeled separately
as there is evidence for differences in growth based on both the age and
length data, as well as patterns in the sex ratios associated with the
length composition data. Natural mortality is estimated within the model
using a natural mortality prior developed by Hamel
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hamel2015}{2015}). A Beverton-Holt stock-recruit
function is assumed. No deviations from the spawner-recruit curve are
estimated.

The length composition data are stratified into 37 5-cm bins, ranging
between 20 and 200 cm. The age data are stratified into ages 0--15+,
conditioned on the same length bin structure. The population dynamics
are computed over a larger range of lengths-at-age, with the 5-cm length
bins extending up to 250 cm and the numbers-at-age computed up to age
20.

\hypertarget{data-weighting}{%
\subsubsection{Data Weighting}\label{data-weighting}}

The Francis data weighting method ``TA1.8'' (Francis, R.I.C.C.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Francis2011}{2011}), as implemented in the r4ss
package was used for all length and age composition data. This method is
based on adjusting the input sample sizes to make the variability in
mean length or age around the model expectation match the variability
expected based on the adjusted input sample size. Sensitivity analyses
to both the McAllister-Ianelli tuning method (McAllister, M K and
Ianelli, J N \protect\hyperlink{ref-McAllister1997}{1997}) and a
Dirichlet-Multinomial approach (Thorson et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorson2017c}{2017}) were also explored.

The weight given to the indices of abundance was adjusted automatically
through the estimation of an additional standard deviation parameter for
each index, which was added to the standard deviation values estimated
within the index standardization process.

No data-weighting algorithm was applied to the discard rate or mean body
weight observations.

\hypertarget{priors}{%
\subsubsection{Priors}\label{priors}}

\emph{Natural Mortality} A log-normal prior for natural mortality was
based on the Hamel (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hamel2015}{2015})
meta-analysis. The Hamel prior for M is lognormal(ln(5.4/max age),
.438). For Big Skate, the maximum age is based on the single 15-year-old
fish observed out of 1034 ages from the WCGBT Survey. This results in a
lognormal(log(0.36) = --1.021651, 0.438) prior.

\vspace{.5cm}

\emph{Survey Catchability} The lack of contrast in the data resulted in
unstable model results under a variety of configurations. In order to
keep biomass estimates within a plausible range, the assessment uses a
revised prior on the WCGBT Survey catchability parameter (\(q\)) that
that is based on one that was originally developed for the 2007 Longnose
Skate assessment (Gertseva, V and Schirippa, MJ
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2007}{2007}), Dorn, M and Cordue, P and
Haist, V (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dorn2007}{2007})), and is being used
for the concurrent Longnose Skate assessment (Gertseva, V.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2019}{2019}). The description that
follows first addresses the method used to develop the original prior,
followed by a description of the additional work used to tailor it for
Big Skate.

The original prior is based on consideration of the availability of
Longnose Skate to the survey gear and the probability that a skate in
the path of the gear would be caught and retained by the gear. The
methodology for developing the prior involves specifying the potential
range in the proportion of fish that are available to the gear and the
potential range in the vulnerability to the gear, and ``best guesses''
for the individual probabilities. These values are translated into a
lognormal prior where the median of the lognormal is the ``best guess''
and the range of plausible values covers 99\% of the lognormal
distribution.

Several factors inform catchability in the survey. The WCGBT Survey
covers the full latitudinal range of Longnose Skate modeled in the
assessment, and thus, the latitudinal availability factor was assumed to
be one (complete latitudinal coverage). The survey coverage exceeds the
maximum depth distribution of Longnose Skates but doesn't fully cover
the shallow end of the skate distribution. A range of 95 to 100 percent
was assumed for the depth availability. A range of 75 to 95 percent was
assumed for vertical availability on the basis that skates are known to
bury in the mud, and therefore some may be unavailable to the bottom
trawl gear.

The largest bounds were placed on the probability of capture, given that
a fish is in the net path. It is known that flatfish can be herded by
trawl gear, and it is possible that this could also occur for skates.
However, it is also possible that skate could avoid the trawl nets. For
capture probability, a range of 75 to 150 percent was assumed. The best
estimates for each of these factors were set at the midpoint of the
range for individual factors, except for the probability of capture,
which was given a value of one. The overall estimate for the survey
catchability was the product of the best estimates, 0.83. The bounds on
catchability are the products of the low and high values for factor
ranges, respectively, which are 0.53 and 1.43. The best guess was
equated to the median of a lognormal distribution and the bounds to 99\%
of that distribution. This gave a normal prior on \(log(q)\), with mean
--0.188 and standard deviation 0.187.

Additional analysis for revising the WCGBTS prior on catchability for
Big Skate focused on the assumptions about depth availability, and on
accounting for untrawlable habitat. In the first case, Big Skate have a
shallower depth distribution than Longnose Skate and encounters in the
WCGBT Survey are most frequent in the shallowest depths (Figure
\ref{fig:WCGBTS_presence_absence_by_depth_bin}). The area of the coastal
waters within the 55--200 m depth range where Big Skate are most often
found was estimated at 4.17 million hectares (C. Whitmire, pers. comm.).
The area shallower than 55 m which is not included in the survey is
estimated at is 1.61 million ha, or 38.5\% of the area within 55--200 m.

An analysis of trawl fishery data (involving both discarded and retained
fish) provided insight into the changes in Big Skate density by depth,
and resulted in an additional factor in the prior. The catch of Big
Skate in depths less than 55 meters is approximately 25\% ?? of that in
deeper waters. We also examined data from an ODFW Flatfish survey
conducted in the 1970s (Mirick
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mirick2019}{2019}), however we found that there
were very few hauls in that study with Big Skate (in 42 of 350 hauls),
relative to the fishery data (where Big Skate were present in 14896 of
160168 hauls, so the new factor has a best-guess of 75\% with a range of
60-90\% ??.

An additional factor for untrawlable habitat, the areas where survey
operations have not taken place because the bottom is too rugged or too
steep, was estimated at ?? within a range of ??-??. Big Skate are
unlikely to occur in these bottom types, so the extrapolation of the
survey density is likely to overestimate the biomass of Big Skate for
these areas.

Given the addition of these two new factors, the new value for (\(q\))
is entered as a prior of 0.710 in the model, with a standard deviation
of ??.

\hypertarget{estimated-parameters}{%
\subsubsection{Estimated Parameters}\label{estimated-parameters}}

A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables
\ref{tab:model_params}.

The base model has a total of 44 estimated parameters in the following
categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1 stock-recruit parameter ($log(R_0)$ controlling equilibrium recruitment)
  \item 1 natural mortality parameter applied to both sexes,
  \item 6 parameters related to female growth and the variability in length at age
  \item 2 parameters relating male growth to female growth,
  \item 3 catchability parameters (1 for the WCGBT Survey and 1 each for the early and late periods of the Triennial Survey)
  \item 2 extra standard deviation parameters (1 for each survey)
  \item 29 selectivity parameters, including 16 related to time-varying retention rate
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a
full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Table
\ref{tab:model_params}.

\emph{Recruitment} The parameter \(log(R_0)\) is the log of the
equilibrium recruitment (in thousands). Other aspects of the
stock-recruit relationship are described below under Fixed Parameters.

\emph{Natural Mortality.} Male natural mortality was assumed equal to
the value estimated for females. Sensitivity analyses were used to test
the impact of both the prior on natural mortality and the assumption of
equal natural mortality for both sexes.

\emph{Growth.} Examination of patterns of age-at-length and
length-at-age indicated unusual patterns of growth for Big Skate. The
youngest fish show near-linear growth, and average size for both sexes
is similar. However, older fish show considerable sex-based differences
in size. This led to the choice to model growth using the ``growth
cessation model'' recently developed by Maunder et
al.~(\protect\hyperlink{ref-maunder2018growth}{2018}). The estimated
growth curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:growth}. The growth cessation
model provided two key advantages over the more common von Bertalanffy
growth model in the case of Big Skate: it allowed essentially linear
growth for the early years and it allowed growth for the earlier ages to
be similar between females and males while diverging at older ages. The
growth cessation model also improve the negative log-likelihood by 45
units relative to the von Bertalanffy growth model.

\emph{Selectivity.}\\
A double-normal selectivity function was used for all fleets to allow
consideration of both asymptotic and dome-shaped patterns. No length
composition data was available for the historical fishery, the
historical discards, or the tribal fishery, so selectivity was assumed
equal for all fisheries in all time periods, and will be referenced
simply as ``the fishery'' in many areas below. For the fishery and the
Triennial survey, the difference in likelihood between dome-shaped and
asymptotic patterns was very small and in the case of the Triennial
survey, the dome-shape occurred at a length beyond almost all
observations, indicating that this shape was likely driven by the fit to
other data sources, such as the index, rather than the length
composition data. The WCGBT Survey was allowed to remain dome-shaped, as
as the model estimated the selectivity peak at a smaller length than the
other fleets, and the likelihood was improved by the dome-shape. The
WCGBT Survey also has the shortest hauls, with 15 minutes or less of
bottom contact, so larger skates may be better able to escape the net.

In order to fit a strong skew in the sex ratios toward males for the
length bins in which the majority of the samples were found, it was
necessary to estimate a sex-specific offset of selectivity. Two offset
parameters were estimated for all fleets, one for the difference in
length at peak selectivity, and another for the maximum selectivity at
that peak. This allows one sex to have a maximum of 1.0 at the peak and
the other to have a maximum less than 1.0. The ascending slope was
assumed equal in all cases, as was the descending slope for the WCGBT
Survey.

Fishery retention was estimated as a logistic function applied to the
selected catch from 1995 onward, to estimate discards within the model.
Discards prior to 1995 were estimated outside the model and input as the
historical discard fleet as discussed above. Three retention parameters
were estimated, the length at 50\% retention, a slope parameter, and the
asymptotic retention rate. The asymptotic retention rate was estimated
as time-varying, with separate parameters covering 1995--2004,
individual years from 2005 to 2016, and 2017--onward. The choice of
these time blocks was made to allow the model to fit the discard rates
during the 2005--2016 period well. This is the period with the most
information about discard rates. The first three years with data on
discard rates and mean body weight of the discarded fish (2002--2004)
were used as the basis for the estimate applied to the earlier years,
those without discard data.

\hypertarget{fixed-parameters}{%
\subsubsection{Fixed Parameters}\label{fixed-parameters}}

The steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curve was fixed at 0.4.
The same value was used in the 2007 Longnose Skate assessment (Gertseva,
V and Schirippa, MJ \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gertseva2007}{2007}) and is
being considered for the ongoing 2019 Longnose Skate assessment. This
value reflects a K-type reproductive strategy associated with
elasmobranchs in general. The influence of the assumption of \(h=0.4\)
on model output was explored via a likelihood profile analysis. No
deviations around the stock-recruit curve were estimated, and the stock
was assumed to be at an unfished equilibrium in the first year (1916).

Parameters controlling the weight-length relationship and
maturity-at-length were fixed at the externally estimated values.

As noted above, the descending limb of the double-normal selectivity
function was fixed at a high value resulting in asymptotic selectivity
for both the fishery and the Triennial Survey.

\subsection{Model Selection and
Evaluation}\label{model-selection-and-evaluation}}

\hypertarget{key-assumptions-and-structural-choices}{%
\subsubsection{Key Assumptions and Structural
Choices}\label{key-assumptions-and-structural-choices}}

The modeled stock was assumed to be a single closed population within
the EEZ of the U.S. West Coast, with fishing mortality the only driver
of changes in abundance. Neither variability in recruitment nor any
other biological or ecological process that would contribute to changes
in abundance was included in the final model. Recruitment variability
was explored but found to be insufficiently supported by information in
the data.

Some modeling choices were made based on similar choices for the
concurrent Longnose Skate stock assessment, such as the division of the
historical fishery into separate fleets for landed and discarded fish
with the same selectivity, and the choice to model the tribal fishery
separately in the recent period. In all these cases, alternative
approaches would likely have yielded similar results, so the exploration
of alternative models focused on the issues that seemed to have the
biggest impact on the estimated dynamics.

\hypertarget{alternate-models-considered}{%
\subsubsection{Alternate Models
Considered}\label{alternate-models-considered}}

Numerous alternative configurations were explored for growth,
selectivity, mortality, and historical discards. A selection of these
alternative approaches were retained as sensitivity analyses.

\hypertarget{convergence}{%
\subsubsection{Convergence}\label{convergence}}

One hundred sets of jittered starting values were generated using the
jitter function built into Stock Synthesis, using jitter input = 0.1.
The same likelihood as the base model was returned by 51 out of the 100
runs, while the others all had worse outcomes (Table \ref{tab:jitter}).
No analysis was conducted for the starting values associated with those
jitter runs which failed to return to the same likelihood as the base
model, but throughout the model selection process, models which started
with a low \(log(R_0)\) parameter or other initial values that led to a
crashed population had convergence problems. This was straightforward to
resolve during the model selection process, but may have been the cause
of many of the jittered models failing to reach the best observed
likelihood. The 49\% failure rate also suggests that the 0.1 jitter
input value was high enough to produce a broad range of starting values
to test the model, where a very high success rate might suggest too low
a jitter value.

\subsection{Base Case Model Results}\label{base-case-model-results}}

The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic
standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params}. Estimates of
derived reference points and approximate 95\% asymptotic confidence
intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1V2}. Time-series of
estimated stock size over time are shown in Table
\ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

\hypertarget{parameter-estimates}{%
\subsubsection{Parameter Estimates}\label{parameter-estimates}}

Values of all estimated parameters are provided in Table
\ref{tab:model_params}. A few key parameters of note include natural
mortality estimated at 0.445, slightly above the 0.36 median of the
prior and with much narrower uncertainty than the prior (Figure
\ref{fig:fit_to_priors}). \(L_\infty\) was estimated at 175.67 for
females and 120.97 for males (based on an exponential offset of -0.373).
The \(log(R_0)\) parameter was estimated at 8.728, corresponding to an
unfished equilibrium recruitment of 6.18 million.

Catchability from the WCGBT Survey was estimated at 0.81, close the
median of the prior applied to this parameter, with uncertainty
estimated as very similar to the uncertainty in the prior (Figure
\ref{fig:fit_to_priors}).

Selectivity was estimated to be asymptotic for the WCGBT Survey (the
only fleet for which it was allowed to be dome-shaped), with the peak
selectivity occurring at 76 cm, below the peak of the fishery
selectivity at 94 cm (Figure \ref{fig:sel01_multiple_fleets_length1}).
These two fleets had a similar estimate for the lower maximum
selectivity for females than males, at 0.696 for the survey and 0.744
for the fishery. Selectivity for the Triennial survey was substantially
different from the other two, with an additional parameter estimated for
the initial selectivity of the smallest sizes necessary to fit the very
flat length compositions from the two years of data available, and with
a peak occurring at 188 cm, far higher than the other two curves. When
converted to age, the selectivity peaked at about age-4 for the WCGBT
Survey, age-5 for the fishery, and ages 7 and 12 for males and females
in the Triennial Survey, respectively (Figure
\ref{fig:sel02_multiple_fleets_age2}).

The length at 50\% retention was estimated to be 66 cm, which is similar
to the length at 50\% selectivity, but the slope of the retention
function was steeper. Thus, the fish that were discarded were primarily
those sizes that were not fully selected (Figure
\ref{fig:sel09_len_flt1sex1}). The asymptotic retention rate increased
from 2004 to 2008 with a peak at close to 100\%, followed by a
decreasing trend from 2012 onward (Figure \ref{fig:retention}).

\hypertarget{fits-to-the-data}{%
\subsubsection{Fits to the Data}\label{fits-to-the-data}}

\emph{Indices.} The observed indices show much more variability than the
model expectation, with the fit to the WCGBT Survey essentially a flat
line (Figure \ref{fig:index2_cpuefit_WCGBTS}). The fit to the Triennial
Survey shows a noticeable change over time due to the separate
catchability parameters estimated for the early and late periods (Figure
\ref{fig:index2_cpuefit_Triennial}).

\emph{Length Data.} The fits to the length data were reasonably good
(Figures
\ref{fig:comp_lenfit_aggregated_across_time}--\ref{fig:comp_lenfit__multi-fleet_comparison}
and
\ref{fig:comp_lenfit_flt1mkt2}--\ref{fig:mod1_4_comp_lenfit_flt6mkt0}).
The observed length compositions for males in both the fishery and the
WCGBT Survey is bimodal, with modes in the 80 cm and 115 cm length bins
for the fishery, and in the 60 cm and 115 cm bins for the survey. The
model expectation has modes in similar locations in both cases, where
the first mode is close to the estimated peak selectivity value and the
second is close to the estimated male L-infinity parameter. However, the
second mode in the model expectation is less pronounced than in the
observed data (Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit_aggregated_across_time}). The
residual patterns in the fit to the length compositions don't show
strong patterns, with the WCGBT Survey data especially well fit. There
are a few large residuals over a range of lengths in the early years as
well as a few years where there were observations of small (under 50 cm)
fish in the retained fishery catch which the model expected would have
been discarded (Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit__multi-fleet_comparison}).
The fit to the length data in alternative models that lacked either the
growth cessation model or the sex-specific offsets to selectivity were
less good (results not shown).

\emph{Conditional Age-at-Length.} The conditional age-at-length data is
likewise fit reasonably well, with some patterns in residuals showing
variability among years, but no clear pattern that is consistent across
years (Figures \ref{fig:age_fit_fishery} and \ref{fig:age_fit_WCGBTS}).

\emph{Sex Ratios.} Sex ratio data is not included in the likelihood as
such, but as a part of the length composition likelihood. The
proportions of females and males are compiled into a single vector that
is compared to the model expectations in the multinomial likelihood. The
patterns in sex ratio by length bin show fewer females than males for
the middle range of sizes (70--120 cm), with a shift to almost 100\%
females for the largest size bins (over 130 cm). These patterns are
shown in Figures \ref{fig:sexratio_len_flt1mkt2} and
\ref{fig:sexratio_len_flt5mkt0}. The approximate uncertainty associated
with the observed ratios is represented by a Jeffreys interval (Brown et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-brown2001interval}{2001}) based on the
combination of the proportion of the lengths with each length bin and
the adjusted input sample size. The use of sex-specific growth curves
was adequate to fit the ratios for the largest bins, but ratio skews
toward males at lengths where the mean ages are similar for females and
males. The fit to this part of the sex ratio pattern required an offset
in selectivity.

\emph{Discards Rates and Mean Weight of the Discards.} Fit to the
discard fraction estimates (Figure \ref{fig:discard_fitFishery}) and the
mean weight of the discards (Figure \ref{fig:bodywt_fit_fltFishery})
show reasonably good fits. The model expectation is able to match the
trend of decreasing discard fractions and decreasing mean weights over
the years 2002--2010 by estimating an increasing trend in the asymptotic
retention rate from 2004 to 2008 with a peak at close to 100\%, followed
by a decreasing trend from 2012 onward (Figures
\ref{fig:sel09_len_flt1sex1} and \ref{fig:retention}). The years
2008--2012 with the highest asymptotic retention rates have little
retention of large fish leading to lower discard rates and smaller mean
weight of the discarded fish. The period from 2011 onward had observer
coverage increased to 100\% for the catch-shares trawl fishery, leading
to more precise data and consistent patterns in the two data types. The
first few years (which form the basis for the estimates going back to
1995), are more uncertain and less well fit, with the discard rates over
30\%. This is inconsistent with the mean weight under 1.5 kg in 2003 and
2004.

\hypertarget{uncertainty-and-sensitivity-analyses}{%
\subsubsection{Uncertainty and Sensitivity

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{itemize}

        \item Allowing all selectivity curves to be dome-shaped

        \item Removing the sex-specific offset on the selectivity curves

    \item Adjusting historical catch by estimating multipliers on discards over blocks of time

    \item Adjusting historical catch to match a time series of fishing mortality for Petrale Sole

  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Results of these sensitivities are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} to \ref{fig:Sensitivity_catch}, and
Tables \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} to \ref{tab:Sensitivity_catch}.
More detailed descriptions of each group of sensitivities is provided
below.

\textbf{Selectivity and catchability (Figure
\ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} and Table
\ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q})}

Allowing the selectivity for all fleets to be dome-shaped resulted in
domed selectivity for all fleets, but only improved the total negative
log-likelihood by 0.9 units, mostly through a slightly improved fit to
the length compositions, although the fit to the surveys was slightly
worse (Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}). Removing the offset
between female and male selectivity caused the negative log-likelihood
to be worse by 18.1 units, mostly through a worse fit to the length
comps but also a worse fit to the conditional age-at-length
compositions. The conditional age data was represented independently for
each sex, so no sex-ratio information was present in the data, but the
growth curves were changed slightly to compensate for the change in fit
to the length data, resulting in a poorer fit to the age data as well.
The scale of the population remained somewhat similar to the base model
under both of these sensitivities (Figure
\ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}).

Removing the prior on catchability for the WCGBT Survey had a large
change in the estimated scale of the population, with the unfished
equilibrium biomass increasing from the 2,224 mt estimated in the base
model to 9,932 mt (``Q no prior on WCGBTS'' in Figure
\ref{fig:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q} and Table
\ref{tab:Sensitivity_sel_and_Q}). However, the change in likelihood was
relatively small, with the total improving by 0.4 units, of which 0.04
was associated with the prior itself.

\textbf{Biology (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_bio} and Table
\ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio})}

The sensitivity analyses related to biology and data weighting included
assumptions about natural mortality (\(M\)), growth, and data weighting
(Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_bio} and Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio}).
Allowing separate estimates of female and male natural mortality led to
estimates of 0.475 for females and 0.395 for males, which are nearly
symmetric around the 0.445 estimate of the shared mortality parameter in
the base model. This difference allows more males to be present in the
population and therefore better matches the skewed sex ratios in the
length composition data. The scale of the unfished equilibrium spawning
biomass dropped to 61\% of the base model estimate due to the smaller
fraction of females living to maturity with the higher \(M\), but the
estimate of total biomass in the unfished population remained at 91\% of
the base model (Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_bio}). The improvement in
likelihood is 2.2 units, which is modest given the extra parameter
estimated. Additional explorations (not shown) indicated that a model
with differential \(M\) and no sex-specific offsets on the selectivity
had much poorer fit to the data than either the base model or this
sensitivity analysis. Therefore, given that the differential selectivity
provided a greater improvement in model fit than the sex-specific \(M\),
only the more influential factor was included in the base model.

Removing the prior on \(M\) had little impact on the model with \(M\)
increasing from 0.445 in the base model to 0.448 without the prior.

The use of either von Bertalanffy (\protect\hyperlink{ref-VonB}{1938})
or Richards (\protect\hyperlink{ref-richards1959flexible}{1959}) growth
models provided poorer fits to both the conditional age-at-length and
length data, and higher estimated variability in length-at-age (Figure
\ref{fig:growth_curve_comparison}). The increase in variability in
length-at-age suggests that the model is using this variability to
compensate for lack of fit to the mean length-at-age. The Richards model
is a generalization of the von Bertalanffy growth model with an
additional parameter allowing a more sigmoidal shape. For females, this
additional parameter was hitting the lower bound of 0.1 resulting in
linear growth up to age 20. This parameter on the bound led to a bad
gradient and a non-positive-definite Hessian matrix, indicated that the
model had not converged to the maximum likelihood estimates. In theory,
the additional parameter in the Richards model should always allow it to
provide a better likelihood relative to the von Bertalanffy, but further
attempts to search for a converged model with Richards growth have not
yet been undertaken.

\textbf{Data weighting and recruitment (Figure
\ref{fig:Sensitivity_misc} and Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_misc})}

The base model sample size adjustments from the Francis
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Francis2011}{2011}) method for the length
composition data were 0.240 for the fishery lengths, 0.067 for the WCGBT
Survey lengths, and 1.0 for the Triennial Survey lengths (constrained to
avoid upweighting as the input sample size was already the number of
fish for this one source). The sample size adjustments for the age data
were 0.084 for the fishery and 0.054 for the WCGBT Survey. Tuning the
sample sizes using the McAllister-Ianelli
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-McAllister1997}{1997}) method had a relatively
small impact on the model results (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_misc} and
Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_misc}), with a lower weight given to the
fishery lengths (0.107) than the status-quo Francis tuning method, and a
higher weight given to the WCGBT Survey lengths (0.637). The lengths
from the Triennial Survey were given similar weight. Ages from both the
fishery and the WCGBT Survey were increased to 0.410 and 0.404,
respectively. The likelihoods could not be compared due to these changes
in the adjusted sample sizes, but the estimated parameters were all
relatively similar to those in the base model. Tuning the sample sizes
using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorson2017c}{2017}) resulting in higher weights
for all length and age data, with sample size adjustments between 0.97
and 1.0 for all of the input length and age data. The scale of the
spawning biomass increased with the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood
(Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_misc} and Table
\ref{tab:Sensitivity_misc}). Given the relatively good fit of the base
model to the length and age data compared to the other inputs,
especially the indices, the alternative data-weigthing methods, which in
general increased the weight on these composition data, did not seem
justified.

\textbf{Catch and discards (Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivity_catch} and Table
\ref{tab:Sensitivity_catch})}

The sensitivity analyses related to discard mortality resulted in little
change in the scale of the population for any scenario (Figure
\ref{fig:Sensitivity_catch} and Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_catch}).
Increasing or decreasing the discard mortality from 0.5 to 0.4 or 0.6
had the least impact, while the two alternative time series of discards
caused the population to fall to a lower level around 1990 and increase
faster in the recent period. The discards based on 3-yr average analysis
simply used the alternative time series of historical discards described
above and shown in Figure \ref{fig:discard_calculations}.

The sensitivity analysis in which historical catch was adjusted by
estimating multipliers on discards over blocks of time made use of the
relatively new ``catch multiplier'' option in Stock Synthesis.
Multiplier parameters controlling the ratio of the discards removed from
the model relative to the input values were estimated for blocks of time
covering the periods 1916--1949, 1950--1959, 1960--1969, 1970--1979,
1980--1989, and 1990--1994. These multiplier parameters were bounded to
keep the input catch relative to the estimated total within the range
0.5--1.5 and a weak Beta prior distribution spanning this range was
applied to the parameters to keep them from hitting the bounds and cause
them to remain at 1.0 in the absence of information in the data.

The resulting pattern of historical discards shows a steadily increasing
catch, with higher catch relative to the input values in all the blocks
up to a peak in the 1980s, followed by a decrease in the estimated catch
for the 1990-1994 period (Figures
\ref{fig:adjusted_historic_catch_comparison} and
\ref{fig:catch_multiplier_catch_comparison}). These changes provide a
greater contrast in the catch history, causing the estimated time series
of spawning biomass to fall to a lower level and then increase faster
from the 1990s onward, thus fitting the WCGBT Survey slightly better
(Figures \ref{fig:Sensitivity_catch} and \{fig:Sensitivity\_catch2\}).
However, the improvement in likelihood for the survey was only 0.3 units
(Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_catch}).

The sensitivity analysis in which historical catch was adjusted to match
a time series of fishing mortality for Petrale Sole for the period
1950--1994 was based on the premise that fishing mortality for Petrale
Sole is correlated with that for Big Skate. Petrale Sole frequently
co-occur with Big Skate in both the fishery and survey (Wallace
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wallace2019}{2019}). Whereas the Dover Sole
population used in the estimation of Longnose Skate discards has been
very stable with \%unfished never estimated as having falled below 63\%
of \(B_0\), Petrale Sole was overfished for decades and the most recent
stock assessment (Stawitz et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Stawitz2015}{2015}) estimated that the spawning
biomass fell to 5\% of the unfished level by 1993 before subsequently
rebuilding to about 30\% of unfished biomass. Therefore, total catch of
Petrale Sole is reflective of both the fishing mortality and the change
in biomass over time. An additional complexity is that while the summer
fishing grounds for Petrale are in relatively shallow water, there is
also a winter fishery on Petrale Sole spawning aggregations in deeper
water where Big Skate are likely less common.

In the Petrale Sole stock assessment, the fishery was divded into
separate Summer and Winter components and further divided between
northern and southern areas, with the dividing line at 42 degrees N
latitude (the boundary between Oregon and California). To develop an
index of fishing mortality, a weighted average of the estimated \(F\)
time series for each of the two Summer fisheries was calculated by
applying weights of 0.424 to the \(F\) from the southern area and 0.576
for the northern area. These weights were based on the average ratio of
estimated Big Skate biomass in the WCGBT Survey north and south of 42
degrees as estimated in the VAST index standardization. The resulting
time series of Petrale Sole \(F\) was then input to the Big Skate model
as an index of \(F\) for the historical fishery. As this index applied
to the combination of both discarded and retained catch, those two
components of the historical fishery were combined. The input catch
values were treated as uncertain and the likelihood weight given to the
index of \(F\) was set high enough to ensure that the \(F\) time series
was matched exactly. The \(F\) time series was fit for the years
1950--1994. Attempts to include the years prior to 1950 in the fit led
to models that did not converge.

The resulting estimates of \(F\) and catch for Big Skate from this
sensitivity analysis were somewhat similar to those derived from the
catch multiplier sensitivity analysis described above, with higher
mortality and catch in the 1970s and 1980s than in the 1950s (Figures
\ref{fig:F_comparison} and
\ref{fig:adjusted_historic_catch_comparison}). The resulting time series
of spawning biomass started slightly above the base model and ended in a
very similar place. To explore the impact of the catchability prior on
this sensitivity analysis, an additional model run (not shown) was
conducted with the prior turned off, which resulted in the estimated
catchability value decreasing only slightly from \(q = 0.828\) to
\(q = 0.815\), compared to the base model estimate of \(q = 0.811\).

\hypertarget{retrospective-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Retrospective Analysis}\label{retrospective-analysis}}

Retrospective analyses, in which the final 5 years of data are
successively removed from the model, showed relatively little change in
the scale of the estimated population, but the uncertainty about the
population size increased (Figure \ref{fig:retro}). The WCGBT Survey
observations were underfit for the final 5 years, so removing these
points, combined with a prior on catchability lowers the status of the
stock, and led to a slightly reduced estimated spawning biomass.

\hypertarget{likelihood-profiles}{%
\subsubsection{Likelihood Profiles}\label{likelihood-profiles}}

Likelihood profiles were conducted over the parameter controlling
unfished equilibrium recruitment \(log(R_0)\), catchability of the WCGBT
Survey (\(q\)), stock-recruit steepness (\(h\)) and natural mortality
(\(M\)). Results of these profiles are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:profile_logR0} to \ref{fig:profile_M_compare1_spawnbio}. The
contribution of different data sources to the changes in likelihood
within the profiles were considered in the context of a change of less
than 1.92 units of negative log-likelihood, sometimes considered small,
based on half of the 95\% quantile of a Chi-squared distribution with 1
degree of freedom.

The profile over \(log(R_0)\) shows that the change in likelihood over a
broad range of values is relatively small compared to models with more
contrast in the data, with a total change in likelihood of less than 4
units over a range of 8.2 to 9.6, corresponding to a range in
equilibrium recruitment of 3.6 million to 14.8 million (the \(log(R_0)\)
parameter is the log of \(R_0\) in thousands). Models with
\(log(R_0) < 8.2\) did not converge. The age data and discard data are
best fit at the highest \(R_0\) considered while the index and mean body
weight data are best fit at the lowest \(R_0\). Only the priors and the
length data are best fit at intermediate values. The length data was
best fit at \(log(R_0) = 8.6\), while the separate components of the
prior likelihood were also best fit at \(log(R_0) = 8.6\) in the case of
the prior on the catchability of the WCGBT Survey, and at
\(log(R_0) = 8.2\) in the case of the prior on natural mortality. The
base model estimate balancing all these components was
\(log(R_0) = 8.728\). The spawning biomass estimates from the models in
the profile were all relatively similar as a result of the models with
higher \(R_0\) also having a higher \(M\) estimate, leading to a similar
number of fish surviving to maturity (the range was \(M = 0.526\) at
\(log(R_0) = 9.6\) to \(M\) = 0.398\$ at \(log(R_0) = 8.2\)).

The profile over catchability of the WCGBT Survey (\(q\)) provides a
better illustration of the information in the data about the scale of
the population, because the prior on \(q\) is no longer influencing the
estimates of all other parameters. The range considered for the
parameter \(log(q)\) corresponded to \(q = 0.5\) to \(q = 2.0\), where
\(q = 0.5\) has the observed survey biomass equal to half of the true
population after accounting for selectivity of the survey, and
\(q = 2.0\) corresponds to the survey observations being double the true
population. The likelihood contributions are represented here both
without and with the prior likelihood (Figures
\ref{fig:profile_logQ_noprior} and \ref{fig:profile_logQ}). The prior
has a much stronger influence on the changes in likelihood over the
range considered, with a total change of greater than 10 units of
negative log-likelihood. The length data is the most influential of the
other components, with a change of 2.6 units over the range of \(q\)
considered, with the best fit occurring at the smallest \(q\) values.
All three sources of length data were best fit at the lowest \(q\)
values with the fishery contributing 71\% of the change, the WCGBT
Survey 27\% and the remaining \%1 from the Triennial survey. The mean
body weight data is also better fit at low \(q\) while the indices and
discard data are best fit at \(q = 1.75\). The age data and the prior on
natural mortality show very little change in likelihood over the range
of \(q\) considered (less than 0.1 unit of negative log-likelihood).

The spawning biomass estimated for the models included in the \(q\)
profile (Figure \ref{fig:profile_Q_compare1_spawnbio}) show similar
trajectories, with the scale of the population negatively correlated
with the \(q\) values as expected.

The profile over steepness of the stock-recruit curve shows less than
0.8 units of likelihood over the range \(h = 0.3\) to \(h = 0.9\). The
best fit occurred at \(h = 0.5\), indicating that a model with steepness
estimated would have been relatively similar to the base model where
\(h\) was fixed at 0.4. However, earlier explorations indicated that
models with \(h\) estimated sometimes produced unstable results, where
small changes in model configuration could cause the parameter to be
estimated at either the upper or lower bound of the 0.2--1.0 range on
which it's defined for the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curve.

The profile over natural mortality (\(M\)) shows that most of the
information in the likelihood about \(M\) was from the length and age
data, with additional information in the discard rates and the mean body
weight data. The prior on \(M\) provided relatively little contribution
to the total likelihood. The length data had the largest change in
likelihood over the 0.25--0.55 range of \(M\) considered, and was best
fit at 0.45, close to the base model estimate of 0.445.

\hypertarget{reference-points-1}{%
\subsubsection{Reference Points}\label{reference-points-1}}

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and
catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model,
(2018). Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) were 590 mt
when using an \(SPR_{50\%}\) reference harvest rate and with a 95\%
confidence interval of 266 mt based on estimates of uncertainty. The
spawning biomass equivalent to 40\% of the unfished level
(\(SB_{40\%}\)) was 1,010 mt.

The 2019 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning
biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished levels (Figure
\ref{fig:ts9_unfished_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). The
relative fishing intensity, \((1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})\), has been below
the management target for the entire time series of the model (Table
\ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}).

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1V2} shows the full suite of estimated
reference points for the base model and Figure
\ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a
steepness value of 0.4.

\hypertarget{research-and-data-needs-1}{%
\section{Research and Data Needs}\label{research-and-data-needs-1}}

We recommend the following research be conducted before the next
assessment.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Extend all ongoing data streams used in this assessment.} A longer fishery-independent index from a continued WCGBT Survey with associated compositions of length and age-at-length will improve understanding of dynamics of the stock. Continued sampling of lengths and ages from the landed catch and lengths, mean body weights, and discard rates from the fishery will be even more valuable for the years ahead now that Big Skate are landed as a separate market category and the estimates will be more precise.

\item \textbf{Investigate factors contributing to estimated lower selectivity for females than males.} Sex-specific differences in selectivity were included in the base model to better fit differences in sex ratios in the length composition data but the behavioral processes that might contribute to this pattern are not understood and other explanations for the sex ratios are possible.

\item \textbf{Investigate the distribution of Big Skate shallower than the 55 m limit of the WCGBT Survey.} This would help with interpretation of the biomass estimates from the survey and potentially refining the associated prior on catchability.

\item \textbf{Pursue additional approaches for estimating historical discards.} The approaches used here were based on averages applied over a period of decades. The catch reconstructions conducted for each state were much more sophisticated, but were applied only to the subset of the catch that was landed. Reconstructed spatial patterns of fishing effort could be used to estimate changes in total mortality over time.

\item \textbf{Improve understanding of links between Big Skate on the U.S. West Coast and other areas.} Tagging studies in Alaska indicated that Big Skate are capable of long distance movements. A better understanding of links through tagging in other areas and genetic studies could highlight strengths or weaknesses of the status-quo approach.

\item \textbf{Conduct studies of mortality of discarded skates in commercial fisheries.} Estimates of discard mortality for skates in general could be improved.

\item \textbf{Improve understanding of catch history and population dynamics of California Skate.} California Skate is the third most commonly occurring Skate in California waters after Longnose Skate and Big Skate and the catch reconstruction indicated that the center of abundance for California Skate is centered around San Francisco, where the fishery was strongest in the early years. If California Skate is found to be at a low biomass compared to historical levels it would have implications for the catch reconstruction of the other two species, as well as suggesting that management of California Skate should be a higher priority.
